[Anand reviews the 2011 MacBook Pro | AnandTech](http://www.anandtech.com/show/4205/the-macbook-pro-review-13-and-15-inch-2011-brings-sandy-bridge/21)

He likes them.


<blockquote>The new 13 is quite possibly the best balance of portability and performance. It's the single largest upgrade you'll find in the lineup. If you own a previous generation 13-inch MBP, the upgrade is 100% worth it. Graphics performance is solid under OS X however questionable under Windows.</blockquote>


I knew this review would hurt even before reading it. If you are in the market for a new laptop, however, Anand's advice is solid gold.
