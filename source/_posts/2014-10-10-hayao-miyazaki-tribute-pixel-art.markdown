Beautiful tribute to Hayao Miyazaki's work:

Via [Kottke](http://kottke.org/14/10/pixel-miyazaki), who also suggests to check out the excellent [8-bit Ghibli](https://www.behance.net/gallery/14924437/8-bit-Ghibli):

This really brightened my day. I love Miyazaki's work, and [Porco Rosso](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104652/) is one of my favorite movies of his. I wasn't expecting to run into it today on the Internet; perhaps this means it's time to watch it again.
