Twitter has once again been making the rounds on the Internet after they announced [a new developer platform](http://online.wsj.com/articles/twitter-to-offer-new-tools-for-app-developers-1413770895) for their service. Far from being a universally acclaimed move, many developers are cautioning against the excitement, reminding people that what Twitter giveth, Twitter taketh away.

Marco Arment, in particular, has been [very vocal](http://www.marco.org/2014/10/20/wsj-twitter-peace-offering) in his distrust of Twitter the company, and with good reason:

> But that’s not the biggest problem — even an anonymous API is shaky ground because it can always change or disappear, like Twitter’s original API did. The problem is still the complete power over an increasingly important communication medium residing in a single company and its single centralized service.

This thought is, I believe, worth additional consideration.


## Twitter the service

As a communication tool, Twitter's meteoric rise to the top of our collective consciousness in just a few years is nothing short of astounding. This popularity is, for the most part, well-deserved: Twitter is remarkably apt at enabling real-time coverage of breaking news and emergencies all over the world, to cite but one example. We have never witnessed such overflow of information before. Corrupt governments being thrown out of office, civil wars being waged on the streets... everything happening on this planet is now broadcast live by millions of on-site improvised reporters, and there's no going back from this.

This incredibly powerful communication tool is, however, a double-edged sword. Without editorial selection of content and, perhaps more importantly, without any way to verify the authenticity of the information in any reasonably fast way, Twitter also enables misinformation at an unprecedented scale: well-known celebrities are often declared dead on a daily basis and the entire Internet mourns for a few hours at a time before the rumor is inevitably dispelled by an official source. Those rumors usually end up fading away as quickly as they came, but sometimes the power of Twitter is wielded by a select few to manipulate the truth and even harass other people. The recent #GamerGate scandal is a perfectly good example of a debate that's being actively enabled by Twitter, where the oppresors are taking advantage of the service to defend their ludicrous stance.
