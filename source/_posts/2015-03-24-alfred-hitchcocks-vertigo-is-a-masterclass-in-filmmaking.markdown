Stunning and insightful piece over at [Cinephilia & Beyond](http://www.cinephiliabeyond.org/) on the intricacies of Hitchcock’s absolute masterpiece. Now, the fact that _Vertigo_ is a masterpiece will probably not come as a surprise, but still. Any excuse to dive deep into this timeless classic is good enough for me.
