Fantastic, inspiring article by Tim Cook on Bloomberg Businessweek:

> While I have never denied my sexuality, I haven’t publicly acknowledged it either, until now. So let me be clear: I’m proud to be gay, and I consider being gay among the greatest gifts God has given me.

> Being gay has given me a deeper understanding of what it means to be in the minority and provided a window into the challenges that people in other minority groups deal with every day. It’s made me more empathetic, which has led to a richer life. It’s been tough and uncomfortable at times, but it has given me the confidence to be myself, to follow my own path, and to rise above adversity and bigotry. It’s also given me the skin of a rhinoceros, which comes in handy when you’re the CEO of Apple.

Well said. Intolerance and bigotry have no place in modern society, and we should all do everything in our power to stop them. I have only the greatest respect for Mr. Cook for having the courage to speak up and hopefully inspire millions of others to do the same.
