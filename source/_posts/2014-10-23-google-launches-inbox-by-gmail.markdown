Interesting new email-based product by Google. Privacy concerns aside, Google is probably the best company in the world when it comes to identifying and extracting relevant information from something as vast and opaque as an email inbox.

I'm interested in trying it, but for now Inbox by Gmail requires an invitation. I've asked for one but I'm yet to hear back from Google, so I can't say much more about it at the moment. If you can spare an invite, please get in touch. Thanks.
