M.G. Siegler:

> At first, I thought it was [kudos-worthy](https://twitter.com/mgsiegler/status/577938295352471552) to realize they couldn’t do this alone. But thinking about it a bit more, it’s ridiculous that they aren’t doing this themselves. This segment of the market isn’t going away, and Nintendo should be taking it far more seriously than they are.

> In a way, it reminds me of [Apple’s partnership with Motorola on the ROKR](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_Rokr) iTunes-enabled phone. How well did that work out? A couple years later, we had the iPhone.

Agreed. As excited as some folks seem to be about the recently-announced licensing agreement, it’s hard to see it as little more than a half-hearted effort on Nintendo’s part. If they really cared about this, they’s do it themselves, as they’ve always done.

If Siegler’s correct, though — and I believe he is — it won’t be long before some of the higher ups at Nintendo start seeing things for what they really are.

Here’s hoping.
