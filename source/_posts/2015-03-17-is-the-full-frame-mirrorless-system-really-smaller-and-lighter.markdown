Great article by Simon Patterson over at FStop Lounge that seriously trolls [Betteridge’s Law of Headlines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betteridge's_law_of_headlines):

> For example, the Sony A7R weighs less than half a Nikon D810 and the Sony A7II takes up about half as much space in the camera bag than a Canon 5D MK III. If we only want a smaller and lighter full-frame camera body, we’d definitely go for the mirrorless camera. But this is only part of the story. What about the lenses?

Much has been said about the advantages of mirrorless cameras but at the end of the day, a full frame lens is a full frame lens no matter how you slice it. And what that means, sadly, is that when you account for the lenses, you don't get to save much in the way of size and weight by picking a Sony A7 II over a DSLR.
