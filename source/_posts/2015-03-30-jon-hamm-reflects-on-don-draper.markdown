As the final season of _Mad Men_ approaches, Dave Itzkoff of The New York Times sits down with Jon Hamm to reminisce about Don Draper. Via [Stephen Hackett](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2015/3/on-don-drapers-carousel-pitch):

> How this years-in-the-making narrative ends for Draper — conclusively or ambiguously; with his redemption or his demise — remains a secret that Mr. Hamm isn’t sharing. He has, however, managed to portray a character that has grown over seven seasons while nonetheless remaining trapped in an existential loop. In a recent interview, he spoke about some of the moments — triumphant and otherwise — that made Don Draper who he was. In these excerpts from that conversation, he recalls how these scenes were created and shares some final insights about the man they reveal.
