Spectacular review by Joshua Ho and Brandon Chester. AnandTech is usually the best site when it comes to hardware-focused reviews, so I was very interested to see how they’d review the Apple Watch, when there is effectively zero information publicly available on its hardware.

Apple’s playing it pretty close to the chest with the S1, but AnandTech has done a remarkable job of shining some light on its hidden secrets. That alone makes this review well worth a read.
