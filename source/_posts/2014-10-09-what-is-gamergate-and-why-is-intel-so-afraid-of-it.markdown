Eric Johnson, Re/code:

> Gamergate has even gone so far as to convince chipmaker Intel to [pull its advertising](http://recode.net/2014/10/01/under-pressure-from-gamers-intel-pulls-advertising-from-gamasutra/) from a gaming site seen as sympathetic to women gamers.

> And why? Because their voices are seen as a threat to the gaming community. In a twisted way, Gamergaters are battling a “corrupting” influence in the gaming press and its adherents, but that influence isn’t corporate scheming — it’s social progress.

> Let’s rewind and retrace how we got here.

Excellent and informative article on how this whole Gamergate mess came to be.
