Stunningly beautiful review by Josh, as ever:

> Right off the hop, the Olympus 75mm f/1.8 may be a mixed bag depending on your goals. The 75mm lens is ideal for in-tight portraiture, blurry backgrounds, and dreamy photos. It’s not meant for anything a full-frame 75mm lens is normally used for. Ever since I purchased the Olympus 12-40mm f/2.8 Pro lens, the 75mm has spent the majority of its time in my camera bag. It’s just not an every day focal length. However, when it’s time to see my nieces and nephews, or when it’s time to venture outdoors for family photos, the 75mm quickly becomes my best friend.

This is the single most divisive thing about the Olympus 75mm lens. It is definitely an impressive tool in the right situation, and for studio sessions it could very well be the perfect lens. However, its awkward focal length makes it a specialty lens and as sharp as it is, its appeal in a Micro Four Thirds kit is somewhat limited due to its size, weight, lack of weather sealing and yes, price.

That said, if your usage could benefit from a fast lens in this focal length, the Olympus 75mm appears to be an absolute jewel and its sharpness and image quality are nothing short of astounding, particularly in Josh’s extremely capable hands.
