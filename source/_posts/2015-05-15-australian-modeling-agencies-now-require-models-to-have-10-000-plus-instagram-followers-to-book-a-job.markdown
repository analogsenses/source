Sam Bailey, writing for _The Daily Mail Australia_:

> General manager of Vivien’s Models Catherine McGill told Daily Mail Australia that they launched an ’influencers’ section two months ago because of the growing need to accommodate client demand for social media numbers.

> 'Our bookers were giving me feedback that clients wanted models who might be blonde, beachy and had a high social media following,' she said.

> 'Now when we’re booking talent, in negotiation process, we talk about the girls numbers.'
McGill says the average expectation of clients will range anywhere between 10,000 - 300,000 followers.

> 'It’s not hard and fast number, but 10,000 is the minimum number clients are asking for,' she said. 

This is the ugly side of the social media-driven world we’ve created.
