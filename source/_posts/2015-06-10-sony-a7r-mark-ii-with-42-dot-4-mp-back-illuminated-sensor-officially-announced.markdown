Today Sony officially announced their new A7R Mark II camera, boasting a 42.4 MP back-illuminated full-frame sensor and the same 5-axis in-body image stabilization system found in the recently announced A7 Mark II, which was fine-tuned to match the performance of the new high-resolution sensor.

Other improvements over the original A7R include the ability to capture 4K video in Super 35mm format as well as full-frame 35mm format — that is, using the entire sensor surface as opposed to only a central crop. It also includes improved AF performance with 399 AF points and a new Fast Hybrid AF mode for video recording.

On the minus side, the new camera is still not fully weather sealed, with Sony claiming only dust and moisture resistance as opposed to full water or splash-proofing.

The new Sony A7R Mark II looks like an amazing camera, with many substantial improvements over the previous generation, as well as over the A7 Mark II. However, with a recommended retail price of $3,200, it will not come cheap. It will be available for preorder on June 17.
