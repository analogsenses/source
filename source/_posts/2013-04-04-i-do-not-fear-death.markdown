[“I do not fear death”](http://www.salon.com/2011/09/15/roger_ebert/)

Roger Ebert back in September, 2011:



<blockquote>I know it is coming, and I do not fear it, because I believe there is nothing on the other side of death to fear. I hope to be spared as much pain as possible on the approach path. I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. I am grateful for the gifts of intelligence, love, wonder and laughter. You can’t say it wasn’t interesting. My lifetime’s memories are what I have brought home from the trip. I will require them for eternity no more than that little souvenir of the Eiffel Tower I brought home from Paris.</blockquote>



What an amazing piece. The ending is priceless.
