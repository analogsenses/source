Shawn Blanc’s most ambitious project yet is now live. As a [subscribing member](http://shawnblanc.net/members/) on his personal site, I’ve been following along Shawn’s progress in designing and building the course right from day one. His unique insight into personal creativity, productivity and focus is something I deeply admire, and I have no doubt the course will be well worth your time and effort should you decide to sign up.

Shawn’s put an incredible amount of thought, effort, care and love into this project. He’s poured his heart and soul into it, and it shows. Today that work is seeing the light of day for the very first time; let’s show him the warmest of welcomes.
