[Ben Brooks](https://brooksreview.net/2014/10/synopsis/):

> I had a crazy idea a while back: why not do my own TabDump now that it is gone? Well, I partnered up with Bradley Chambers and created just that. We will be covering a lot more than just tech news, so come look and let me know what you think.

What a great idea. I'm really looking forward to seeing what they do with it.
