Impressive milestone:

> The tiny titans in question are bits of strontium monofluoride, dropped to 2.5 thousandths of a degree above absolute zero through a laser cooling and isolating process called magneto-optical trapping (MOT). They are the coldest molecules ever achieved through direct cooling, and they represent a physics milestone likely to prompt new research in areas ranging from quantum chemistry to tests of the most basic theories in particle physics.

Cool (no pun intended). Now we're one step closer to cryo-sleep and interstellar travel. I just hope there are no actual [xenomorphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alien_(creature_in_Alien_franchise\)) out there.
