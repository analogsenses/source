David Pogue:

> Photos is meant to look, feel, and work exactly like Photos on the iPhone and iPad. It is yet another attempt by Apple to both unify the learning curve across devices and to put velvet handcuffs on you. The more benefits you get from sticking to an all-Apple ecosystem, the more likely you are to stay in it.

If it works without hiccups — and that’s a big if — it looks like most iOS users are going to feel right at home in the new Photos for Mac app. I'm definitely curious to try it, although most of my photos live in Lightroom these days.
