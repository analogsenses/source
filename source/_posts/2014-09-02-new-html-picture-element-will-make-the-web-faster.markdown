Scott Gilbertson on the new HTML Picture element, which will allow mobile devices to selectively load smaller-res images on websites:

<blockquote>
Web developers recognized this problem very early on in the growth of what was called the "mobile" Web back then. So more recently, a few of them banded together to do something developers have never done beforeâ€”create a new HTML element.
</blockquote>

Fascinating story.
