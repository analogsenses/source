Cult of Mac:


<blockquote>LAUGH as the security forces of an oppressive fascist dictatorship try to crush your cards with a 1.6-ton (3,200-pound) vehicle. CHUCKLE at their pathetic attempts to zap the pictures from the card with anything less than a 10,000 gauss magnet. And TAKE IT EASY as these government stooges lamely try to soak the card in water for up to 24 hours. The ignorant fools.</blockquote>
