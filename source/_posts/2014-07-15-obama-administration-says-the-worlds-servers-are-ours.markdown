[Obama administration says the world’s servers are ours | Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2014/07/obama-administration-says-the-worlds-servers-are-ours/)



<blockquote>In essence, President Barack Obama's administration claims that any company with operations in the United States must comply with valid warrants for data, even if the content is stored overseas. It's a position Microsoft and companies like Apple say is wrong, arguing that the enforcement of US law stops at the border.</blockquote>



The US government's total lack of respect for their citizens' privacy knows no borders. Shameful.
