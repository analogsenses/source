Jenn Stanley, writing for _Next City_:

> Unlike other cities that [currently have](https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/us-city-bike-lanes-bike-safety) or are [building protected bike lanes](http://nextcity.org/daily/entry/boston-plan-protected-bike-lanes), this is the first time a city in the U.S. is building a fully protected intersection.

> The city hopes that in addition to aiding cyclists, the new lane will increase local commerce. The area will also feature murals by local artists.

Sounds like a very smart move. Check this video detailing the intersection:
