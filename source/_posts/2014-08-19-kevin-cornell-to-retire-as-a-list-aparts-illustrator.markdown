<blockquote>After 200 issues—yes, _two hundred_—Kevin Cornell is retiring from his post as _A List Apart_’s staff illustrator. Tomorrow’s issue will be the last one featuring new illustrations from him.

Sob.</blockquote>

Sob indeed.

Via [Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/links/2014/08/18/my-favorite-kevin-cornell/), who adds:

<blockquote>I was fortunate enough to have him illustrate the very first (out of print) [Rands t-shirt](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-pleasant-elsewhere/). Can’t wait to see what he tackles next.</blockquote>

[I have it](http://instagram.com/p/CbdGV/), and it's always been my favorite of all the Rands t-shirts.

Like Michael, I can't wait to see what Kevin does next.
