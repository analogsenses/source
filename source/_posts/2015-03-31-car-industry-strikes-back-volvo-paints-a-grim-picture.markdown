I was _this_ close to linking to another article on this topic a couple days ago, but I trusted Mikael Colville-Andersen to drive the point home much better than I ever could:

> The latest piece in [our ongoing Car Industry Strikes Back series](http://www.copenhagenize.com/search/label/car%20industry%20strikes%20back) writes itself. This time it’s Volvo doing its best to draw your attention to the fact that motorists kill obscene amounts of people - including themselves - by placing the responsibility on cyclists and pedestrians. It’s a smoke screen and this time it’s sprayed on. It is [Ignoring the Bull in Society’s China Shop](http://www.copenhagenize.com/2009/10/sacred-bull-in-societys-china-shop.html) taken to the next level.

> Volvo Life Paint. Seriously. Life paint. 

> But hey... it’s not for the 35,000+ people killed by or in cars in the EU alone by Volvo and their Big Auto homies (around the same in the US and 1.2 million worldwide - not to mention the tenfold more killed by pollution from cars and trucks or the hundreds and hundreds of thousands more injured...). 

> And no, it’s not [rational ideas like helmets for motorists](http://www.copenhagenize.com/search/label/helmets%20for%20motorists) or making motorists responsible by [forcing them to have external airbags](http://www.copenhagenize.com/2010/03/airbags-instead-of-bike-helmets.html).

> It’s spray on paint.

The worst part is that I’ve already seen plenty of cyclists that are actually _happy_ this product exists. I mean, how ridiculous is this? A _car_ manufacturer developing — and selling — a special reflective paint for _cyclists_ to spray on themselves — all with the noble goal of not getting themselves killed by the very cars Volvo makes.

Disgusting.

**UPDATE:** There’s [a follow-up article](http://www.copenhagenize.com/2015/03/make-life-shine-yes-you-volvo.html) on Copenhagenize.com. They’ve created [a petition](https://www.change.org/p/volvo-european-commission-volvo-should-retrofit-all-their-cars-and-trucks-with-their-life-paint) on Change.org to get Volvo to offer free Life Paint for every Volvo car on the roads today. I just signed it.
