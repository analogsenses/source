Finally:

> Today, we’re extremely excited to announce [Flickr for iPad](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/flickr/id328407587?mt=8). We’ve heard you loud and clear asking for an official app on Apple’s beautiful, large retina display, which makes it easy and enjoyable to access, organize and share your stunning photos from anywhere. The new Flickr for iPad app will be available globally in eleven languages.

It's a universal app, so if you have the Flickr iPhone app installed on your iPad — like most sane people — the next time you update it you'll get the iPad version automatically.
