<blockquote>We learn how to create by taking in the creations of others. We learn how to shape an experience for someone else by having experiences of our own. So, you want to know how to make someone weep for joy? Have someone make you weep for joy.</blockquote>


Fantastic read. There is so much to take in from here, that it would be a crime to spoil it. Trust me, go read it. Now.

With my thanks toÂ [Christian Sheehan](http://www.christianjames.me/post/7226488905), who spotted it first.
