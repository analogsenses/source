Ben Brooks has a great article for those looking for an alternative to Adobe Lightroom:

> I briefly thought about buying or subscribing just for Lightroom, but that seemed silly. So I kept thinking and I came across a new app in my Reading List: [Flare 2](http://flareapp.com/).

> I never gave Flare a go, it looked gimmicky to me when it came out — like Instagram for the Mac — but in truth it is exactly what I want. And probably just about what every normal photographer needs: a quick way to get your photos ready to share.

> It’s dead simple.
