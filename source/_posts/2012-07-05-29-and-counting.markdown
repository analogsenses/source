It's that time of the year again. I like how [Shawn](http://twitter.com/shawnblanc/status/219778212740349952) put it a couple days ago:



<blockquote>Today's the day all those forums I joined and abandoned so many years ago send me birthday email.</blockquote>



Every year, this day brings something special (besides ancient forum email). It's an opportunity to say Hi to old friends and spend some time with the people you love. To review everything that's happened to you in the last 365 days and appreciate how far you've come, and the challenges that lie ahead.

Today it's my turn. Tomorrow it may be yours. Make the most of it, because these days are numbered, and they're meant to be savored.

Best,
√Ålvaro.
