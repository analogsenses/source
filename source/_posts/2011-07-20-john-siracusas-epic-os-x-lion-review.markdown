The favorite moment of every Mac geek has finally arrived: John Siracusa's Epic-length review of the next major version of Mac OS X is now up over at Ars Technica.

Grab something to drink, find a nice, comfy couch and treat yourself, it only happens every two years or so. With a bit of luck, you'll have finished this one by the time the next one is published.
