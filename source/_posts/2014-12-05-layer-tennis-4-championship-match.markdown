The Season 4 Championship Match of [Layer Tennis](http://www.layertennis.com/) is finally upon us. 

Featuring Kelli Anderson vs. James White and narrated by Mr. John Gruber, this promises to be an exciting match, and an excellent way to wrap up a memorable season. 

And remember:

> As usual, Layer Tennis league officials do not encourage wagering on the outcome of this match, nor the consumption of any adult beverages prior to the completion of volley 8. (Also as usual, they don’t exactly discourage such things, either.)
