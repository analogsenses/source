The Copenhagen Wheel basically substitutes your rear bicycle wheel and transforms any regular bicycle into an e-bike.



<blockquote>Riders are given a boost as they pedal by measuring their effort, instead of using a throttle. This preserves the normal biking experience while enabling riders to bike faster, farther, and easier.</blockquote>



Awesome. I'm not particularly interested into this whole e-bike thing, but if you're in the market for one, this is definitely worth a look.
