Pretty good — and free — update to Tweetbot for Mac. I’ve been a Tweetbot user since it was first released and, though I love it, this update was long overdue. Ever since OS X Yosemite was released the app had become incredibly unstable for me, to the point of being nearly unusable. Fortunately, I haven’t seen any of the same issues with the new version so far. That alone would be more than enough reason to update, but it just so happens that I also really like the updated Yosemite-style UI, so this one’s pretty easy to recommend.
