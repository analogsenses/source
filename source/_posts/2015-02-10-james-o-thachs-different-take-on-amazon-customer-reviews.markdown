[James O. Thach](https://twitter.com/JamesOtisThach) is a terrific writer who specializes in a very specific brand of literature: Amazon customer reviews. For a taste of his unique approach to product reviews, take his very last one on Amazon, aptly titled “[A Helmet for Oberyn](http://www.amazon.com/review/RL5LKH00EW0BG/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm)”:

> Whether you're a veteran biker, a new rider, or a vengeful prince facing the Mountain in a trial by combat, I can't stress enough the importance of proper head protection.

> There are plenty of options in the helmet world, but this model has some features to recommend it. Its open-faced design allows the freedom to deliver scathing accusations. (But don't talk too much-- 80% of brain injuries occur while monologuing). Its light-weight, composite shell is virtually uncrushable. And most importantly, it includes goggles. No one's pressing their thumbs through these peeper-protectors. You may wind up with a case of raccoon eyes, but it beats the heck out of the alternative.

> The urge to go commando will always be there. But remember, whatever heroic journey you're on, you'll never get there without a head.

Priceless.
