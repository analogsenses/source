In this week’s episode of Candid, we start off with a brief conversation on exposure compensation: what it is, why it’s there, and how to use it. Then we move on to the main topic of discussion for the week: camera bags. Lots and lots of camera bags.

Among other things, Josh and I share our experiences with ONA bags, and Marius is reviewing a new Wotancraft messenger bag. We also take on the eternal argument: backpacks vs. messenger bags. Good stuff.

As a personal note, this is easily my favorite episode of Candid yet. There are many fun, spontaneous moments during the show, and the conversation seems to flow more naturally than in previous weeks.

Oh, and there’s also the Bag That Shall Not Be Named.

Enjoy.
