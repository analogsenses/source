To round up today’s photography-heavy links, here’s an interesting lens comparison by Jordan Steele:

> Ok, so this is one of those comparisons that really isn’t particularly fair. You’ve got a $1,600 Zeiss prime up against a $900 Fuji prime, and the test bed cameras aren’t the same resolution. There are lots of problems with testing like this, but I’m going to do it anyway. Why? It’s fun! Today I’m comparing the Sony Zeiss FE 35mm f/1.4, mounted on the Sony A7 II and the Fujinon XF 23mm f/1.4, mounted on the Fuji X-T1. Both of these lenses have approximately the same field of view, and they both have the same fast f/1.4 maximum aperture. They are also both highly regarded lenses for their respective systems, so let’s see how they stack up. And please, please take these tests with a grain of salt. This is a fun comparison, and both of these lenses are really quite excellent.

They are indeed. These are two of the finest 35mm-equivalent lenses available for _any_ system, and both are compelling enough to be system sellers on their own. But how exactly do they stack up?

> I said up front that this wasn’t really a fair test, and it really isn’t. The Zeiss was tested with a higher resolution body, and the lens itself is nearly double the cost. However, despite the resolution difference, it’s easy to see that the FE 35mm f/1.4 is exceptional. It takes an extremely good Fuji 23mm f/1.4 and makes it look mediocre in comparison. Zeiss has done something rather incredible with the lens.

Some of Jordan’s comparison shots are actually hard to believe, especially considering how well-regarded the Fuji lens is by every reviewer out there. Judging by the results, the Zeiss lens is truly in a league of its own, and may very well be the single best 35mm lens available today for any system, at any price.
