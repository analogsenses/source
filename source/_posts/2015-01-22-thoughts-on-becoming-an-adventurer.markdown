[Speaking of](/2015/01/22/matt-gemmell-on-work/) finding _your_ thing, Alastair Humphreys wrote a great article on how he managed to turn his passion for adventure into an actual job. This is great advice for anyone trying to make a living doing what they love. If you're considering something like this, you will probably recognize much of yourself in these points:

>* I love almost every aspect of what I do.
* I love being self- employed: the freedom and the responsibility and the pressure.
* I think Iâ€™m probably now un-employable.
* I love being creative.
* I appreciate that building a profile helps generate exciting opportunities. (And I have come to accept -though not enjoy- the weird world of relentless self-promotion that being a career adventurer requires. I remain uncomfortable with people praising me more than I deserve, and I continue to get very angry and upset with the inevitable haters that your self-promotion will attract.)
