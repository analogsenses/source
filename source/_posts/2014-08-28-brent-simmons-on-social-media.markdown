<blockquote>My blog’s older than Twitter and Facebook, and it will outlive them. It has seen Flickr explode and then fade. It’s seen Google Wave and Google Reader come and go, and it’ll still be here as Google Plus fades. When Medium and Tumblr are gone, my blog will be here.

The things that will last on the internet are not owned. Plain old websites, blogs, RSS, irc, email.</blockquote>

I couldn't agree more. It doesn't matter how big a certain social platforms may be today, its long-term survival is far from certain. If you want your work to endure the test of time, you must publish it on your own platform.
