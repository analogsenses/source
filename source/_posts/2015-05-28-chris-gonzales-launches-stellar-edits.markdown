Exciting announcement by Chris Gonzales:

> This is where I come in. _**Stellar Edits**_ is a professional editing service I’ve created to help indie creators publish their words with confidence. Everyone has a unique voice, and I want to help you strengthen yours.

> Let’s tell your story better.

Every time I’m working on a lengthy piece I wonder how some guys[^jsell1] are able to publish thousands of edited words per week without any noticeable decrease in quality or polish.

[^jsell1]: Jason Snell, I’m looking at you.

The reason I wonder is because writing is the easy part. It’s where all the fun happens and if you get in the zone, you can easily get through a whole piece in one sitting. The problem is, once you’re done writing you still have a long way to go if you want your piece to be polished and ready for publication. If you aspire to maintain a certain standard for your work, you have to _edit_.

And guess what? Editing is _hard_.

It’s hard not only because it’s less fun to do — which it is — but because as the original author, you’re probably not even equipped to edit your own words professionally. Great editing goes way beyond simple grammar-fixing, it’s all about making sure that the message gets through to the audience as clearly as possible and if you’re the one making the mistakes, you’re probably not going to be able to fix them on your own.

A brilliant editor you can trust is probably one of the most — if not _the_ most — valuable assets any writer can have.

I’m really excited about this. Everything we can do to increase the level of polish and professionalism of the written Web is a win in my book, and Chris just scored a big one for the team. I know I would trust him with anything and I’m sure once you try his services, you’ll never look back.
