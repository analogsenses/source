Great trip, gorgeous photographs:

> For this trip, I decided to pack three cameras and three lenses:

> 1. The Leica M-E with the Canon 50 f/1.4,  
> 2. The Leica MP with the Voigtlander Nokton 35 f/1.4, and  
> 3. The Hasselblad 500c/m with the Zeiss 80 f/2.8 CF Planar  

Michael makes a very compelling case that film and digital should’t be mutually exclusive. If you can enjoy both formats for what they are, theres’s really no reason to limit yourself to one of them.
