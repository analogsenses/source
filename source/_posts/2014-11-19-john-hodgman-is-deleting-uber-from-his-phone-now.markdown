John Hodgman has decided to stop using Uber after [one of its executives](http://www.buzzfeed.com/bensmith/uber-executive-suggests-digging-up-dirt-on-journalists) suggested they should dig up some dirt on several journalists — particularly Sarah Lacy from PandoDaily — to protect the company from negative press coverage:

> I like Uber. I know some don’t. I don’t intend to blackmail them.

> And I _really_ don’t want to take that crummy car I was so glad to hang up on two years ago. 

> But I just can’t get into a car with those guys anymore. 

Well said. 

[For a series of unrelated reasons](http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/10/15/inenglish/1413365771_971371.html), Uber is struggling to gain traction in Madrid. I admit I was curious to try it but after this, there's no way I'm using the service.

It's unfortunate, but companies like Uber listen only when customers speak with their wallets.
