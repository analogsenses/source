Fascinating chart by Gregor Aisch and Kevin Quealy over at _The New York Times_:

> How can we best put the gap between Curry and the best three-point shooters in history in context? Over the past 30 years, the number of 3-point field goals has trended steadily upward. If we project that trend into the future, 402 becomes a perfectly natural number of 3-point field goals for an N.B.A. player to make. 

> In the mid-2030s.

Insane stats from the NBA’s best three-point shooter ever.
