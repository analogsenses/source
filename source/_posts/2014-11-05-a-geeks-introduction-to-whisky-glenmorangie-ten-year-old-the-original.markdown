Aah, Glenmorangie. I had been warned by those in the know that this would be a highlight of [my journey](/2014/10/09/the-finer-things-in-life-a-geeks-introduction-to-scotch/); the first one I was likely to _really_ enjoy. Boy, were they right. This is the first time I've caught myself refilling the glass with anticipation, and letting my mind wander off to some ridiculously enthralling fantasies as I drank. But let's start at the beginning, shall we?

## The Glenmorangie distillery

The Glenmorangie distillery was founded in 1843, when William Matheson bought the Morangie farm in [Tain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tain) and converted its brewery into a distillery, renaming it Glenmorangie.

Glenmorangie is a Highland distillery, and boasts the tallest copper stills in all of Scotland. They use water from the Tarlogie Springs, which are the reason the Morangie farm was there in the first place. In order to guarantee the necessary water supply, Glenmorangie bought approximately 600 acres (2.4 km^2) of land around the springs during the 1980's, when the area started to develop and competition became more likely.

Since its origins, the distillation process used by Glenmorangie requires a staff of 16, known as [The 16 Men of Tain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_BO7kotEBg), who learn the craft of distillation via hands-on experience and then personally pass on their knowledge to their successors. They work year-round with the only exception of Christmas and periods of maintenance.

## Glemorangie Ten Year Old - The Original

According to their [official website](https://glenmorangie.com/en), Glenmorangie currently produces 15 different single malt whiskies. That's pretty impressive and I'm sure there's a variant in there to suit most anyone's preferences. Their core product, however, is [The Original](https://glenmorangie.com/en/glenmorangie-the-original), a ten year old single malt whisky, matured in ex-bourbon oak casks and which they describe as "soft, mellow and creamy", as well as "perfect for enjoying at any time". I'm usually pretty skeptical of any claims made in marketing product pages but I have to say, they really nailed this one.

Knowing how to market and sell a good product is arguably as important as the product itself and in this, Glenmorangie excels. Approximately ten years ago, they redesigned all of their bottles in an attempt to gain international recognition as a luxury brand, albeit still clearly aimed at the mass market. As a result, they now boast some really impressive designs across their product range that start with the elegant curves of the bottles and go all the way to the packaging and presentation. In the case of The Original, the design is garnished with several nice touches, such as the engraving on the cork which reads 1843, the year the distillery was founded.

The Original is a light-colored single malt. I would say it's between 0.2 (pale staw) and 0.3 (pale gold) on the [Whisky Magazine](http://www.whiskymag.com) color chart. Now, Glenmorangie uses caramel coloring in their whiskies, albeit "only for standardization", according to their [Head of Distilling and Whisky Creation, Bill Lumsden](http://whiskyadvocate.com/whisky/2010/11/15/the-bill-lumsden-interview/). Sadly, that means there's not much we can say about this whisky by its color alone.

## The nose

Here's when things start getting interesting. My first reaction to The Original was of equal parts surprise and incredulity. I was expecting something along the lines of my previous single malt, Glenfiddich 12, where the first nosing is a bit harsh — although by no means unpleasant. Instead, I got a wonderful wave of spicy and oaky scents, with no traces of peat and no burn whatsoever. And that was even before adding a bit of water to open it up even more. As I got more acquainted with it, I slowly started to find hints of vanilla, followed by more oak. It's certainly one I could spend hours inspecting without ever getting bored.

There's one thing though, I'm not quite seeing: both [Master of Malt](http://www.masterofmalt.com/whiskies/glenmorangie-original-10-year-old-whisky/) and [All Things Whisky](http://www.allthingswhisky.com/?p=733) describe this one as fruity, but I'm not really finding lemons or peaches anywhere here. Of course, my nosing abilities still have a long way to go, so take this with the customary football-sized grain of salt. As a novice though, I'm quite fond of The Original already, and I'm sure I'll be going back to this one for quite some time.

## The palate

## Final words

Glenmorangie has been the best-selling single malt in Scotland almost every year since 1983. I can't really think of a higher compliment than that. Scots _really_ know their whisky; if they love Glenmorangie, who am I to argue?
