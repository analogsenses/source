Marco Ament:


<blockquote>I’ve been assuming that everyone heard about this yesterday, but it’s still news to many, so it’s good to yell about it. If you’re responsible for any servers or VPSes at all, and they run any of the affected versions of OpenSSL, you need to patch them ASAP.</blockquote>



Solid advice from Marco regarding [Heartbleed](http://heartbleed.com), the OpenSSL security bug that's been making the rounds lately.
