This is an interesting review. Given how much Chris Gampat personally loves his original E-M5, I was expecting nothing short of unconditional praise for the new E-M5 Mark II. However, it appears he’s not totally won over by the new camera:

> In many ways the OMD EM5 Mk II is the successor to an already nearly perfect camera, but still doesn’t get it quite right. It adds much more complications (sic) to the Mk I’s elegance and during the duration of our review, we couldn’t totally get our muscle memory wrapped around the camera.

> Does that mean that you won’t? No way; but it will take a longer amount of time ergonomically speaking.

> Is it a nice camera? It’s a great camera, but there are many other great options out there. It’s at a nice price point and pretty much outperforms anything else in this specific market category due to the lens selection, but we’re not sure that the camera is strong enough to stand on its own without said lenses.

Make of that what you will. Personally, I believe the new camera offers plenty of compelling features, at least on paper. For instance, the fact that the original E-M5 lacked Wifi seems absolutely ridiculous at this point, and the silent electronic shutter adds some genuinely new functionality that wasn’t possible before. Other than that, sure, at the end of the day it always makes more sense to put your money towards better lenses and if you’re happy with your current camera, there’s never a feature so compelling that it makes upgrading a total no-brainer. That said, if you’re already in the market for a new Micro Four Thirds camera, it looks like the E-M5 Mark II is hard to beat.
