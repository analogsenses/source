[Japanese animation legend Hayao Miyazaki to retire | The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/9/1/4684268/studio-ghibli-says-hayao-miyazaki-is-retiring)

I know I'm a little late to the party on this one, but I just have to link to it anyway:



<blockquote>Hayao Miyazaki, theÂ legendary Oscar-winning Japanese animator known for directing Studio Ghibli movies such as Spirited Away, My Neighbour Totoro, and Kiki's Delivery Service, is retiring from feature-length film production.</blockquote>



Mr. Miyazaki is one of my all-time favorite filmmakers. His work is a perfect reminder that our imagination knows no boundaries, and can conquer anything.
