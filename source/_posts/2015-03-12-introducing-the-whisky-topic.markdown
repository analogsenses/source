First episode of this very entertaining new podcast by Mark Bylok — of [The Whisky Cabinet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1770502378/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1770502378&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=Z5ZQZJMXLMGVUEMK) fame — and Jamie Johnson.

In my mind, the true test for any whisky-related podcast is whether listening to it actually makes you want to drink whisky. I’m happy to report that I could hold off for all of seven minutes before pouring my first one.

Enjoy.
