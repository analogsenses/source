Jaclyn Ginter, my friend Josh’s lovely wife, is launching a new fashion and lifestyle site today.
With her impeccable taste and his great photographic skills, Beauttype is sure to delight all kinds of readers.

Check out her “[Back to Burgundy](http://beauttype.com/blog/2015/8/back-to-burgundy-1)” post to get a taste for what’s coming. Really cool stuff.
