From the Panic Blog:

> [Transmit iOS 1.1.1](http://panic.com/transmit-ios/) is out, fixing a few bugs in our surprisingly powerful file management app for your iPhone or iPad.

> Also, at Apple’s request, we had to remove the ability to “Send” files to other services, including iCloud Drive.

> In short, we’re told that while Transmit iOS can download content from iCloud Drive, **we cannot upload content to iCloud Drive unless the content was created in the app itself.** Apple says this use would violate 2.23 — “Apps must follow the [iOS Data Storage Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/data-storage/) or they will be rejected” — but oddly that page says nothing about iCloud Drive or appropriate uses for iCloud Drive.

This is getting ridiculous. [Marco Arment](http://www.marco.org/2014/12/08/transmit-rejection) has a good theory on why these seemingly arbitrary rejections keep happening all the time:

> One hand isn’t talking to the other: engineering makes great features available to developers that could be used to build amazingly useful and powerful applications, then the App Store bans anything beyond their most trivial uses.

> This sure feels like the ramifications of an internal turf war. I hope the higher-ups at Apple realize how important it is to resolve this quickly, because their devices, users, and developers are all suffering unnecessarily.

Apple needs to get their act together on this, and soon.
