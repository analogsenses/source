Speaking of the leaked celebrity pictures:

> It doesn’t matter if the stolen pictures were of landscapes or boobs, it was still theft and the only person to blame is the person who did the theft. Not the victim.

> If your house is broken into you, don’t call Schlage and get pissed at them because the lock on your door was bypassed — you call the cops and they go after the person who broke in (not you, not Schlage).

That's precisely what most people seem to forget with this whole thing. There is not a system in the world that is 100% impervious to malicious attacks. However secure a system may be, there is always some risk that your data may be accessed.

Instead of obsessing over who's to blame, perhaps we should all be focusing more on finding the people responsible.
