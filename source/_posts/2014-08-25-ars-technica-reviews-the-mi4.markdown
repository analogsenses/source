[Ars Technica reviews the Mi4](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/08/xiaomi-mi4-review-chinas-iphone-killer-is-unoriginal-but-amazing/3/)

This is just surreal:



<blockquote>Everything here is top notch: The best specs, fantastic build quality, a beautiful screen, a dirt cheap price, and software that, while different, works both aesthetically and functionally. If only the company came up with its own hardware design. If Xiaomi ever does apply itself with some original designs, look out world, because this company will be going places. </blockquote>



If you're going to copy Apple, this is the way to do it: shamelessly, and with zero regard for any possible legal repercussions. When you don't have to work too hard on the design, you can focus relentlessly on execution. Samsung could learn a thing or two from these guys.
