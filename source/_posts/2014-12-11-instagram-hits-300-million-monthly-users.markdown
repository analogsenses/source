John Constine, TechCrunch:

> Itâ€™s no fad. Just nine months after hitting 200 million users, [Instagram now says 300 million people](http://blog.instagram.com/post/104847837897/141210-300million) use its photo app every month, with 70% of them coming from outside the US. That makes Instagram officially bigger than [Twitter, which had 284 million active users](http://techcrunch.com/2014/10/27/twitter-beats-in-q3-with-revenue-of-361m-but-slowing-user-growth-drags-its-shares-down-8/) as of six weeks ago.

That's impressive.
