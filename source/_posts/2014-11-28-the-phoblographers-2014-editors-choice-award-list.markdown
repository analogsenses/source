Today, The Phoblographer published their [2014 Editor’s Choice Award List](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/11/28/phoblographers-2014-editors-choice-award-list/):

> We’ve been very, very busy this year. Lots of new cameras and lenses were announced and we’ve seen tons of innovation this year across the industry overall. There have been many great products released this year in the photo world and we’re here with a massive roundup of the very best.

These are all great products, no doubt. However, keep in mind that this list only includes products that were _reviewed by The Phoblographer in 2014._ That means that, while being excellent products, they may not necessarily be the ones you should spend your hard-earned money on. 

The world of product reviews has a marked tendency to praise the new and shiny over the old. Usually, this approach works well for the majority of consumers: with newer technology come new features and enhancements that normally end up making for an overall better product. But it's not always as cut and dried as that. Sometimes, a product is so good that it takes the competition a couple generations to regroup and take a meaningful shot at it.

2013 was a remarkable year for photography. There were some product releases towards the end of the year that are just as good as the ones in The Phoblographer's list and in some cases, arguably even better. 

Take the excellent Olympus OM-D E-M1 Micro Four Thirds camera, for example. That was a truly revolutionary product that put Micro Four Thirds cameras in the same league as high-end DSLR's in terms of build quality and features. In fact, it was the reason many professional photographers decided to give the Micro Four Thirds system a serious shot at becoming their preferred setup for high paying jobs like weddings, product shots, travel photography, etc.

You could argue that the technical evolution of the Micro Four Thirds system has been so impressive in the past few years that it was only a matter of time, and that it would have gotten there eventually. But the fact remains, the E-M1 was the first credible alternative to a full-frame DSLR for the professional photographer and in fact, many of them believe it still is.

The Panasonic GH4 and the Fujifilm X-T1 — both released in 2014 — are the two main competitors of the E-M1. They're all crop-sensor cameras roughly in the same price segment and they all offer comparable features. However, each camera has its own particular strengths:

* The differentiating feature of the X-T1 is its bigger APS-C sensor that enables it to create a shallower depth of field, as well as having better low-light performance than the other two.

* The Panasonic GH4 has amazing video capabilities, and is able to record video in up to 4K resolution at 30 frames per second. That's insane.

* The main features that the E-M1 has up its sleeve are its rock-solid build quality and its 5-axis in-body image stabilization technology that to this day, remains unrivaled by any other camera or manufacturer, including full-frame DSLR's.[^camera1]

[^camera1]: The recently announced Sony A7 Mark II introduces 5-axis image stabilization for the first time in a full-frame camera. However, it hasn't been tested yet so we still don't know how it compares to the Olympus technology.

Each of these features is noteworthy enough to justify choosing one model over the others. More importantly, each of these features is clearly aimed at a different type of user. For example, if you shoot tons of video, you'll probably be better off with the GH4. If you shoot predominantly in low light and/or want the shallowest depth of field, you'll be happier with the X-T1. If you shoot in rough weather or in unstable conditions, the E-M1 is the one that will suit you best. And if you do all of the above, well, you can buy always all three of them. See? Problem solved.

And don't get me started about the lenses.



With that in mind, I would like to offer my own recommendations
