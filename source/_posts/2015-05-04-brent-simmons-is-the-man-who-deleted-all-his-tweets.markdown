Excellent piece by Brent Simmons:

> I have a number of good reasons not to like Twitter: how poorly it’s treated third-party developers (some of whom are my friends); how it’s become the bright and shining home of bullies, outrage, and the mob mentality; how it’s fallen in love with TV and celebrities; how it’s turning into yet another way to show me ads.

> But those aren’t my reasons for deleting my tweets. Instead, it’s because Twitter is a blogging (or micro-blogging, really) service that doesn’t meet my requirements, which are:

> 1. I should be able to host my content using my own domain, and

> 2. I should be able to move to another service (or to my own server) without anybody noticing the difference. (Links shouldn’t break, etc.)

A bit on the extreme side of things, but he has a point. If you use Twitter as a micro-blogging platform, you should be aware of the sacrifices you’re making, and what you’re giving up in exchange for its convenience.
