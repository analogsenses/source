[TechCrunch clarifies AOL censorship incident, blames Moviefone instead | TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/16/actually-aol-didnt-ask-us-to-tone-it-down-moviefone-did-and-their-editor-in-chief-should-be-fired-2/)

Great article by Paul Carr on how AOL didn't actually ask TechCrunch to "tone down" [their post](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/12/the-source-code/) about the marketing strategy behind the movie [Source Code](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0945513/):


<blockquote>Apparently someone at Summit didn’t like the “snark” in Alexia’s post.

All in all, a great read. Paul's honest-to-god assessment of the situation and criticism of AOL are praise-worthy:


<blockquote>Actually, Patricia, you only have two loyalties: one is to your readers and one is to the company that signs your paychecks. That’s it. You do not – emphatically _do not_ – have a responsibility to “stay on good terms” with movie studios. On the contrary, when a movie company asks you to try to strong-arm a college into dialing down her editorial voice, it’s in your best interests as a professional editor to tell them to go fuck themselves.</blockquote>
