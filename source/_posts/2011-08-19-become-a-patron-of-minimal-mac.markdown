I know I'm a bit late to the party on this one, but I wouldn't forgive myself if I missed it. As of a few days ago, you can become a patron of [Minimal Mac](http://minimalmac.com), and support the amazing work that [Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.net)Â is doing over there.

In case you don't know about it, Minimal Mac is a site that explores the concept of "enough" in our relationship with computers and technology in general, with a specific focus on the Mac platform and the rest of the Apple ecosystem. It has been a personal favorite of mine ever since it launched, about two years ago.

The pitch is really interesting as it is, but what I find most compelling about it is the unique feel that Patrick has managed to achieve with the site. You see, Minimal Mac doesn't pretend to know it all and be a beacon of absolute truth. Instead, it aspires to be a light you can use to hopefully help you find your own particular brand of truth. What works for you may not be what works for Patrick, or for me. And that's okay. Nobody has all the answers. When it comes to the relationship you choose to have with the technology around you, there is only one guru: you.

And so the search is the same for all of us, Patrick included. And trough his work on Minimal Mac we get a chance to explore these exciting ideas together, and hopefully find the balance that feels just right for us. The combination that is enough.

If, like me, you enjoy this concept, you should consider [becoming a patron today](http://minimalmac.com/patronage). For just $5 a month you can subscribe to Patrick's personal newsletter, and you will get special access to his work as it evolves in his head. Think of it as your personal little hole in Patrick's wall, through which you'll be able to get a peek of his creative process. As a patron you will not only be supporting his efforts, you will also be ensuring the continuity of Minimal Mac, and maybe helping to make it even better.

Of course, the problem in today's world is that people don't like to pay for what they can get elsewhere for free. Especially content. It is so devalued by today's standards that it's hard to find a compelling reason to justify the expense. But good content is always worth it, and Patrick's content is as good as it gets. The way I see it is pretty simple. I just ask myself: Do I get $5 worth of value (a pint of beer) out of Patrick's work every month? If it depended solely on me, would I pay that amount in order to ensure its continuity, support him and allow him to devote as much time to it as he feels comfortable with? The answer in both cases is ridiculously evident: a resounding yes.

Patrick is a terrific writer, and such a nice guy that he even goes out of his way to ease the concerns of the doubtful, making it crystal clear that it's possible to unsubscribe at any time, no questions asked. But trust me, after a few weeks sharing the road with him, you'll realize that this was one of the smartest decisions you ever made, and the only doubts you'll have will be about what you can do to [support him even more](http://keepingitstraightbook.com/).

Good luck, my friend.

Onward!
