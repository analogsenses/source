Ben Brooks:

<blockquote>The fragility of free is a catchy term that describes what happens when the free money runs out. Or — perhaps more accurately — when the investors/founders/venture capitalists run out of cash, or patience, or both. Because at some point Twitter and all other companies have to make the move from ‘charity’ to ‘business’ — or, put another way, they have to make the move from spending tons of money to making slightly more money than they spend.</blockquote>


Great piece on why it is always worth paying for the applications and services that you use every day. I am currently working on a long-form piece on this very same topic, but from a different angle.

I also like to pay for the software and services that I use, but honestly I had never thought about it in terms of protecting their long-term existence. To me it was always about supporting the hard work of the developers and the countless hours they put into making the apps. I have huge respect for their work because I know how difficult it is to make a truly great app.
