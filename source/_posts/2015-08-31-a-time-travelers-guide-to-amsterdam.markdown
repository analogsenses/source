Wonderfully interesting article by Inge Oosterhoff for _Messy Nessy Chic_:

> Amsterdam’s historic city center houses many old buildings – most of which have been around for many centuries – rebuilt and repurposed to fit the needs and preferences of each new generation. And as the epicenter of everything cool and new in the Netherlands, Amsterdam is constantly evolving.

> This little Time Traveler’s Guide to Amsterdam lists some of the best places where history meets hip, so you can enjoy both simultaneously on your next trip to the Dutch canal town…

I love seeing old pictures of places that remain in use. The Time Travel moniker seems absolutely spot-on for the type of emotions they evoke.

**Note:** I originally meant to include this piece on last Saturday’s issue of _Morning Coffee_, but the _Messy Nessy Chic_ site was going through some domain name issues at the time and I decided not to risk it. Those issues seem to have been resolved since then, so here it goes.
