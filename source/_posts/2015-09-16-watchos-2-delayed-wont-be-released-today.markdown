It looks like Apple Watch wearers will have to wait a little longer for the first major update to watchOS. Matthew Panzarino, writing for _TechCrunch_:

> Apple has delayed the release of watchOS 2, which was expected to be available today to owners of the Apple Watch.

> “We have discovered a bug in development of watchOS 2 that is taking a bit longer to fix than we expected,” an Apple spokesperson told TechCrunch. “We will not release watchOS 2 today but will shortly.”
