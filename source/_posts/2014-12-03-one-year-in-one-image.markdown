Norwegian photographer [Eirik Solheim](http://twitter.com/eirikso) used 3,888 different pictures to capture an entire year in one image:

> I’m currently working on a new time lapse project. Not a [sort-of-time-lapse](http://eirikso.com/2010/01/04/one-year-in-90-seconds/). But a true one. To put it short: I’ve had an SLR camera in my window at the same spot for one year. Snapping an image every half hour. Resulting in some pretty nice time lapse videos I’ll post here in a couple of days. But first a still image.

Whoa.

> **It shows one whole year. January at the left and December to the right.** You can clearly see that we have a pretty long winter and a decent summer here in Oslo, Norway.

This is easily one of the most amazing images I've ever seen.
