Drew Coffman’s review of Peak Design’s [Everyday Messenger](http://amzn.to/23BoGig) camera bag was published today on _Tools & Toys_:

> This is a bag constructed to not just hold your camera, but _everything you need_. And it’s clear that Peak Design has sweated every single detail you could possibly imagine. The bag is something special.

I’ve been wanting to test this bag ever since it was announced, long before it started shipping. I still haven’t managed to get my hands on one, but Drew’s review confirms all my suspicions: it’s incredibly well designed, and built to the highest standard. And Drew’s amazing photography is on point as usual, which certainly doesn’t hurt.

If you’re in the market for a new camera bag, it looks like the Everyday Messenger should definitely make your short list.
