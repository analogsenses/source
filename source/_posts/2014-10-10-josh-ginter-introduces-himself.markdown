> So, with that said, I wanted to say hello — a true hello — for the first time. As The Newsprint grows and as I try new things, I want everyone to know there is a very average human being on the other side of this screen who merely hopes to impress you for about 30 to 90 seconds once a week. Here goes.

Refreshingly honest article, that all but confirms what we already suspected: that on top of being a great writer, Josh Ginter is a pretty decent human being.

Thanks so much for writing this, Josh. It takes a lot [to put yourself out there](http://www.analogsenses.com/2014/09/15/catharsis/) and I, for one, am very glad that we got to know you a little bit better today. Hopefully one day we'll get to introduce ourselves in person. I'd like that.

Here's to more introductions, and more great writing.
