> I start my new job as a developer at the Omni Group today. You already know them and their wonderful products, and I’ve expressed my admiration for them here on my blog many times.

> But, before I talk about how I’m excited for this new job, I’ll reassure [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co/) users: Vesper will continue, and I will continue as its developer.

It seems like it's great news for everyone. Best of luck to Brent in his new adventure.
