Brianna Wu:

> I have a folder on my hard drive with letters from dozens and dozens of women who’ve abandoned their dream of becoming game developers due to Gamergate, some as young as 12. 

> You’d hope that the gaming press would provide some sort of check on the unrelenting sexism in the game business, but the truth is, they’re complicit in creating our Gamebro culture. One of our largest gaming sites, IGN, has written one [single, weak article addressing Gamergate](http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/24/on-the-problem-of-harassment) where they don’t even mention it by name. I wish I could say I was surprised, but this is the site that advertises itself as “broverload.”

> All this horror begs the question — what can be done?

It boggles my mind how some jerks can publicly threaten and harass innocent women and get away with it. Something needs to change.
