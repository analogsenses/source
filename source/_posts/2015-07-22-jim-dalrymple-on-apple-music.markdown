Jim Dalrymple shares the reasons that moved him to deactivate Apple Music on all of his devices. It’s a frustrating story and, if these issues become widespread enough, he may not be the only one to do it. But there’s more:

> As if all of that wasn’t enough, Apple Music gave me one more kick in the head. Over the weekend, I turned off Apple Music and it took large chunks of my purchased music with it. Sadly, many of the songs were added from CDs years ago that I no longer have access to. Looking at my old iTunes Match library, before Apple Music, I’m missing about 4,700 songs. At this point, I just don’t care anymore, I just want Apple Music off my devices.

> I trusted my data to Apple and they failed. I also failed by not backing up my library before installing Apple Music. I will not make either of those mistakes again.

This is a disaster. Deleting actual files from a user’s device is such a sensitive task that it should never happen by accident.

My experience with Apple Music has been similarly underwhelming, especially the part about adding songs and playlists to my music library. It’s just a deeply unintuitive process and I don’t know how much longer I will put up with it.

So far I haven’t experienced any data loss, but I did make a full backup of my iTunes library before activating Apple Music, just in case. It was surprising to realize I just didn’t trust Apple to get this right on their first attempt. That’s telling.

Apple continues to enjoy a stellar reputation for services and devices that mostly “just work”, but screw-ups like this one certainly don’t help.
