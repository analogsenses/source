Like I said in the last issue of [Morning Coffee](/2015/09/12/morning-coffee-issue-number-14/), I’m not a big fan of the Leica Q, which is why I didn’t immediately rush to read this review when Josh Ginter linked to it [last week](http://thenewsprint.co/2015/09/10/andrew-kims-leica-q-review/). Having read through it now, I can say I have a much better understanding of why so many people seem to love this camera. Andrew’s review is visually gorgeous, and makes lots of good points on the strengths and weaknesses of the Leica Q. 

My biggest criticism of the camera comes down to its relatively limited usability for the price, especially when compared with non-Leica interchangeable-lens cameras. The Leica Q is available for preorder [on B&H](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1160027-REG/leica_19000_q_typ_116_digital.html) for $4,250, which is a crazy sum to pay for a fixed-lens camera, even if it has a Leica logo on it.

Then again, Leica cameras have long been several times more expensive than the competition, and that hasn’t stopped people from buying them, so what do I know. And it’s worth keeping in mind that even though $4,250 is certainly a lot of money, it’s still less than half the price of the current [Leica M](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009FQSXYA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B009FQSXYA&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=LDOM2FCLM2IJJOFD) camera plus a [28mm f/2 Summicron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000U9IQPC/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B000U9IQPC&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=GYLJD62RGY6ZWMPU) lens. As surreal as it sounds, if you’re a Leica photographer who shoots mostly with a 28mm lens, the Leica Q offers an opportunity to save some serious cash.

Not that most Leica shooters worry terribly about that sort of thing, but still.
