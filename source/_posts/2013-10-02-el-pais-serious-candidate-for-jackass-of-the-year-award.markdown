Mind-bogglingly bad article about Apple in El País, Spain's highest circulation newspaper. This is how it starts:



<blockquote>Suddenly, the Apple store resembles a Walmart.</blockquote>



Unsurprisingly, it's all downhill from there. This has become a shameless trend in El País lately: their Apple-bashing pieces are often filled with false information and downright misleading, nonsensical claims:



<blockquote>They are selling less, they are no longer the ones to start the rumors, they are not in the media spotlight as often, they keep issuing apologies, competitors are cropping up everywhere, response is no longer as quick as it used to be, and Wall Street sharks appear to be toying with Apple shares the way they once toyed with Spain or Italy’s risk premium.
</blockquote>



So sad, to think that newspapers like this one were once the guardians of journalistic integrity, and have now been reduced to little more than click-bait whores.
