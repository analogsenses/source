> But post-World War II, a “Vermeer” painting sold to Nazi Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring was traced back to van Meegeren -- a painting of such high quality that experts agreed no one could have possibly fabricated it. Accused of plundering for the Germans, the artist was sentenced to death. In an odd twist, van Meegeren was given one last chance to prove his innocence: If he could produce a brilliant forgery before the eyes of court-appointed witnesses, he'd be spared. What ensued would make the man one of the most popular figures in the Netherlands.

> This is the story of Han Van Meegeren, the most dramatic forger of the 20th century.

What a fascinating character. I'm a sucker for white-collar crime stories.
