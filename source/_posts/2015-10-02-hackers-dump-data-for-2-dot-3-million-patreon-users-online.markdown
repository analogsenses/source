> The data was made available for anyone to download, and Troy Hunt, owner of [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), was able to extract the information and analyze the information in the file:

<center><blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">New breach: 2.3M email addresses from the Patreon breach. 12% were already in <a href="https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned">@haveibeenpwned</a> <a href="http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k">http://t.co/U0QyHZxP6k</a></p>&mdash; Have I been pwned?
