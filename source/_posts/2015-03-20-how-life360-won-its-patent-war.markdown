Great reporting by Joe Mullin of Ars Technica. Last year, Life360 CEO Chris Hulls received a patent demand letter from a company named AGIS, threatening to sue if they didn't agree to license four of their patents. Hulls's response was as hilarious as it was ballsy:

> _Dear Piece of Shit,_

> _We are currently in the process of retaining counsel and investigating this matter. As a result, we will not be able to meet your Friday deadline. After reviewing this matter with our counsel, we will provide a prompt response._

> _I will pray tonight that karma is real, and that you are its worthy recipient,_

> _Chris_

And thatâ€™s just the beginning.
