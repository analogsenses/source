> While technically this is a “hiatus,” I think it’s safe to assume that the Macworld Expo as we knew it won’t come back. Maybe it will take some other form—there are lots of amazing Apple-themed events out there—but I’ve got my doubts. The MacIT conference is a good one, and I’m glad it will be continuing.

Sad news.
