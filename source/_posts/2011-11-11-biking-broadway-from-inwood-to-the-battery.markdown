[Biking Broadway from Inwood to the Battery | The New York Observer](http://www.observer.com/2011/11/manhattan-in-five-minutes-biking-broadway-from-inwood-to-the-battery/)

Have you ever asked yourself just how big Manhattan is, really? Well, it's REALLY big, but the great thing about it is not its size.

Join in for a bike ride across all of Broadway, the oldest avenue in New York City: starting from the Bronx and all the way down to Bowling Green, it is a wonderful tour of the City that Never Sleeps.

New York is a city with many different faces, and there's a version that is just right for each one of us. You just have to find the one you like best ;)
