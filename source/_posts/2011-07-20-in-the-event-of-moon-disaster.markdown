Incredibly emotional memo prepared to be used in case the Apollo 11 didn't make it safely onto the Moon:


<blockquote>In ancient days, men looked at the stars and saw their heroes in the constellations. In modern times, we do much the same, but our heroes are epic men of flesh and blood.</blockquote>


Today marks the 42nd anniversary of its landing: the first time a human being set foot on our only satellite. A great, inspiring story for all mankind that thankfully had a well-deserved happy ending.

Thank you, gentlemen. You made us believe that anything is possible.
