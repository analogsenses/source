Dieter Bohn, writing for _The Verge_:

> That’s right: beginning today, a select set of Android Wear smartwatches (and all future watches) will work with the iPhone. The app should be rolling out worldwide soon. It’s been a long time coming — and it means that Google will be challenging the Apple Watch on its home turf. Those Android Wear watches will be both cheaper and more varied than the Apple Watch — just like Android itself.

Sounds like huge news. Maybe even doom-bringing news for the Apple Watch.

But wait, here’s the “but” you were waiting for:

> There’s an important caveat, though: when paired to an iPhone, Android Wear watches can’t do as much as the Apple Watch. Nor can they do as much as they can when paired to an Android phone.

So, by and large, the case remains: if you own an Android phone, go with an Android Wear smartwatch; if you own an iPhone, the Apple Watch remains the natural choice. At the end of the day, all this seems to be much ado about nothing.
