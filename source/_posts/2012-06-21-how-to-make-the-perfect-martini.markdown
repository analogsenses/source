[How to Make the Perfect Martini | The Art of Manliness](http://artofmanliness.com/2009/05/04/how-to-make-the-perfect-martini/)

To complete your assignment, here's the appropriate etiquette to prepare an original, classic Martini (which uses gin instead of vodka):



<blockquote>Strain the concoction into two martini glasses (I say two because martinis need to be drunk in the presence of beautiful women. The same logic goes for the olives. You use two, as Sinatra put it, so there’s one for you, and one for the beautiful gal that’s about to walk in the door.) In go the olives. Out go the day’s troubles.</blockquote>



Yes, sir. A million times yes. Suddenly I'm feeling thirsty.
