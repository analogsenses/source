This year's Halloween was fun. I had always wanted to dress up as V, the main character in Alan Moore’s awesome graphic novel “[V For Vendetta](http://www.amazon.com/V-Vendetta-Alan-Moore/dp/1401207928/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?ie=UTF8&qid=1288639805&sr=8-5)”. Such a tremendous work of art.

For the less inclined towards comics, there’s also [an excellent film adaptation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0434409/) from the Wachowski Brothers (The Matrix), starring Natalie Portman as Evey Hammond, and the amazing Hugo Weaving as V. Just hearing Weaving’s deep, penetrating voice is enough to give me the chills.

After goofing off for a few hours in V’s skin, I can tell you one thing, though: drinking through that mask is uncomfortable as Hell. No wonder he went mad. Other than that, fun all around in good company. There’s no better recipe for a truly great Halloween night ;)

Here are some pics taken throughout the night. You can click through to view the complete set on Flickr.

See you next year!
