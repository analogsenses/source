AllThingsD:


<blockquote>An updated version of that magazine’s iPad app lets users subscribe to the weekly magazine for $5.99 a month, or the equivalent of a $1.50 an issue. That’s a steep discount from the app’s old model, which only sold individual issues for $4.99 a pop.</blockquote>


Finally. A classic magazine is at last available  in a digital edition (and internationally) at sane prices. For those of us who live overseas, getting the print edition was never a realistic option. Now, it's an instant subscribe.

It makes so much sense that I'm convinced in the near future almost every publication will offer similar deals for digital-only editions. The New York Times, Time, Sports Illustrated... they all have already announced their plans to do so. And the rest will follow soon.

Today is a happy day for enthusiastic readers. Dead-tree magazines are a thing of the past. The future is now.
