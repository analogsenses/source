Owen Williams, writing for _The Next Web_:

> The users discovered the issue in May when using a new Lenovo laptop that automatically and covertly overwrote a system file on every boot, which downloaded a Lenovo updater and installed software automatically, even if Windows was reinstalled from a DVD.

> The only problem is that nobody actually asked for this software, and it persisted between clean installs of Windows. Lenovo was essentially exploiting a rootkit on its own laptops to ensure its software persists if wiped.

Stay classy, Lenovo. Here’s some free advice for you: if users want to get rid of your software so bad that they’re formatting their entire drives, forcing it up on them may not be the best way to go. How about making sure your software doesn’t suck in the first place?
