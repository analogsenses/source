[All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king."](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_that_is_gold_does_not_glitter)

**J.R.R. Tolkien (1892-1973), **_The Lord of the Rings_ (Reminded by Bjornino from Tennis Planet, thanks!)
