[Speaking of Standing Desks | Marco.org](http://articles.marco.org/268)


<blockquote>I got used to the standing desk after a few weeks. I don’t even notice it anymore. It’s easier to take coffee breaks because I’m already up — I just need to start walking. I burn more calories and strengthen my legs all day instead of sitting and getting fatter. No complaints on this one.</blockquote>


Great post from Marco, explaining in great detail how his own back problems motivated him to build [his very own standing desk](http://www.marco.org/2007/07/24/my-newly-created-standing-desk-at-work-i-found-a) (out of Diet Coke cans!). He eventually moved to [a new one](http://www.marco.org/2009/01/28/new-desks-from-left-mine-davids-jacobs), but remains convinced that standing is the way to go.
