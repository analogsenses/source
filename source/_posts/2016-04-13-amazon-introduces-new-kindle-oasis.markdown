This looks interesting. On one hand, I appreciate the slimmer design, ergonomic grip and the cleverness of the dual battery system. That’s Amazon at their best. On the other hand, though, $289.99 seems like an awful lot to spend on a Kindle reader.

If you ask me, the main problem with today’s Kindle lineup is that the venerable [Kindle Paperwhite](http://amzn.to/1VVh0EX), at $119.99, is still the best deal, and hands down the one to buy. It offers practically the same reading experience as the new Kindle Oasis for less than half the price. No matter how you look at it, that’s a hard pill to swallow. Especially considering that you can spend the difference on a pile of excellent books to, you know, _read_.
