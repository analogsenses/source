Arielle Duhaime-Ross, The Verge:

> Two-player limit Texas hold’em poker has finally been solved, according to [a study](http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1259433) published in Science today. Scientists have designed a computer program, named Cepheus, with a strategy for the game that is so close to perfect that statistical analysis shows it can’t be defeated by a human poker player, even if that player competed against the computer for an entire lifetime. This means that no matter how the game starts out, the computer will win or break even in the long run — making it essentially unbeatable.

There goes my gambling career. Oh well.
