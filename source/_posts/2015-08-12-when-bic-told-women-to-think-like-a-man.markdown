Marisa Bate takes Pen manufacturer Bic to the woodshed on account of their incredibly tone-deaf ad campaign on National Women’s Day:

> That all changed around 10am yesterday. The internet caught wind of Bic’s \#HappyWomensDay campaign and the maker of the world’s most inconsequential stationery became the internet’s Most Sexist Thing Ever in a couple of moments.

> The advert shows a woman smiling, with the phrase “Look like a girl, Act like a lady, Think like a man, Work like a boss”.

> I forwarded it on to two colleagues who had an identical response: “Is this a joke?”

Funny thing is, at the end of the day the joke was on Bic. In a matter of minutes, thousands of responses from all over the Internet ranged from [hilarious](https://twitter.com/TechnicallyRon/status/631098706352316416) to downright [scathing](https://twitter.com/molocapetown/status/631045640781438976).

Here’s hoping that, at the very least, Bic’s executives learn something from this. Although, if the company’s [history](http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidvinjamuri/2012/08/30/bic-for-her-what-they-were-actually-thinking-as-told-by-a-man-who-worked-on-tampons/) is anything to go by, chances are slim.
