[What Happens When A 35-Year-Old Man Retakes The SAT? | Deadspin](http://deadspin.com/5893189/what-happens-when-a-35+year+old-man-retakes-the-sat)



<blockquote>Many times, I had to skip a question because I couldn't figure out the answer, and then I got that paranoia that's unique to someone taking a standardized test. I became fearful that I had failed to skip over the question on my answer sheet. So every five seconds, I'd double-check my sheet to make sure I didn't fill out my answers in the wrong slots. One time I did this, and so I had to erase the answers and move them all forward. Only I had a shitty eraser, which failed to erase my mark and instead smeared the mark all over the rest of my sheet. FUCK YOU, TRICK ERASER. I HATE YOU.</blockquote>



Aaah, the College admission tests. Good times.
