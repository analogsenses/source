Kickstarter pledges hit a pretty significant milestone last month:

> On October 11, the Kickstarter community pledged its two billionth dollar toward bringing creativity to life.

That’s just an insane number. If you want to know more about how exactly all those dollars were pledged, follow the title link for a set of cool infographics showing all sorts of different breakdowns, be it by amount pledged, by reward, by category, or many others. It is only by looking at the raw data like this that you can get an accurate idea of the massive scale Kickstarter operates at today — and they’re still growing, fast.

Kickstarter is not without its faults, but it’s not an understatement to say it’s changed the way products are created in the digital era.
