My review of the leather Bond Street camera bag by ONA was published last month on Tools & Toys. I’ve been slow to link to it because, well, life got in the way, but here it is.

This has become an instant favorite of mine. It’s a bag I use every single day, not just to carry my camera, but far more important stuff: my glucose meter and insulin pen. I had been searching for a stylish bag of the right size, and the Bond Street is just what I’d been looking for. Not too small, and not too big. Just _right_.
