Interesting and clever Kickstarter project. The O is a small wearable device you can attach to your essential items — like your smartphone, keys and wallet, for example. It will alert you whenever you leave an item behind via its companion smartphone app.

The project has less than 2,000 £ and 22 days to go to get funded, so it’s very likely to succeed. Check it out.
