My review of the [Sony Zeiss FE 16-35mm f/4](https://www.amazon.com/Sony-16-35mm-Vario-Tessar-E-Mount-Lens/dp/B00NGTN25C/?tag=analogsens-20) lens was published earlier this week on _Tools & Toys_. This was my first review after the summer break, and it was a tricky one to write.

First of all, I’m not very experienced when it comes to ultra-wide angle lenses. I’ve always been much more drawn to the standard and short telephoto ranges, and the wider end always felt a bit alien to me.

However, trying new things is how we learn, so when the opportunity came up to take a week-long trip to Lisbon, I knew I wanted to try a wide lens to capture the beautiful natural landscapes that Lisbon, and especially the neighboring region of Sintra, are known for.

So I took a look at my options and eventually decided to rent this lens and take it with me for the trip. I had it for a total of ten days before sending it back, which is admittedly less time than I usually spend with a lens before reviewing it. All things considered though, I think I managed to come away from the experience with a fair assessment of how the lens performs, and a better understanding of what the ultra-wide angle range is all about.
