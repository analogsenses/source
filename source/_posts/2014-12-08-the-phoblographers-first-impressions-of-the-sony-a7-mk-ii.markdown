Seems exactly what many people were expecting: a slightly improved version of the original Sony A7 with built-in 5-axis in-body image stabilization:

> What we’re very happy about though is the image stabilization that can surely endure most problems that you’ll encounter when shooting if you practice logical exposure manipulation.

I admit I was hoping for a more enthusiastic reaction, but it's true that the A7 was already an excellent camera, so there was not much margin for improvement to begin with.
