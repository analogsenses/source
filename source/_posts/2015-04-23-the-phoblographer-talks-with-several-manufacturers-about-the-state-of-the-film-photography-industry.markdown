Interesting article. Not one word about Ilford though, which strikes me as a huge omission. As commenter [Daniel Bayer](https://plus.google.com/114165974469736185316) points out:

> No journalism piece is ever perfect but leaving out Ilford in this one is like leaving out Jupiter on a story about the solar system.ï»¿
