###[Climbing El Capitan’s Nose | Matt and Joanne Stamplis →](https://joannestamplis.wordpress.com/2009/09/16/the-nose-el-capitan/)

The Nose is perhaps the most iconic rock climbing route in the entire world. It's 1,000 feet high and usually takes multiple days to ascend. Matt and Joanne Stamplis attempted the climb back in 2009, and they took some pretty incredible pictures along the way. I was getting goosebumps just by looking at the images, but the actual narration is just as great. It took them four days and seven gallons of water to climb The Nose, but climb it they did. What an awesome story.

###[Climb Yosemite’s El Capitan Like a Rock Star—From Your Computer | Andrew Bisharat →](http://adventureblog.nationalgeographic.com/2015/06/24/yosemite-climbing-google-maps-street-view/)

Speaking of El Capitan, it is now possible to experience the adventure from the comfort and safety of your home. Google has digitally mapped the entire route using the same technology they use in Street View, and [the result is incredibly cool](http://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/yosemite/). This is a great way to complement Matt and Joanne’s story.
