Glenn Fleishman:

> The sad truth has been that, while profitable from week one, the publication has had a declining subscription base since February 2013. It started at such a high level that we could handle a decline for a long time, but despite every effort — including our first-year anthology crowdfunded a bit under a year ago — we couldn't replace departing subscribers with new ones fast enough.

Sad news, no doubt. You can help them go out in style by backing their [Year Two anthology book](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/glennf/the-magazines-year-two-book-an-anthology-of-curios) on Kickstarter.
