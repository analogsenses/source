Awesome portrait by the great David Lanham.

David is a terrific artist who works at The Iconfactory designing icons and other graphic elements. I really like his work, and his imagination is only equalled by his talent to translate ideas into images with amazing results.

Back in the summer, with the arrival of Apple’s iPhone 4, David started doing a few portraits over FaceTime. Then, he posted some of them on [his Twitter account](http://twitter.com/#!/dlanham). The response was so great that in the next few days he was flooded with a gazillion requests from his followers, yours truly included :P

A few months later, I finally had a chance to sit down and talk to him while he sketched the first draft. He was very nice and the experience was really great. I even got a sneak peek of the new iPhone game from The Iconfactory:_ [Astronut](http://astronutapp.com/)_, which features his artwork and is really fun. Then, over the next few days the digital process would come, where David’s talent really shines. He even endured my OCD comments all the way through, which I can tell you is not easy to do! :P

You can see the final portrait below. I’m really amazed and it has exceeded all of my expectations. All in all, a wonderful experience and the confirmation that, besides a great artist, David is a terrific guy.

If you want to get to know him and his work better, pay him a visit on [his website](http://dlanham.com). I assure you that you will not regret it.

Thanks, David!
