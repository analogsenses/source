[Google to Acquire Nest](http://investor.google.com/releases/2014/0113.html)

Well, this is awkward:



<blockquote>Google Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to buy Nest Labs, Inc. for $3.2 billion in cash.</blockquote>



In case you don't know Tony Fadell, Nest's CEO, he is the man behind Apple's iPod. As [John Gruber points out](http://daringfireball.net/2014/01/googles_acquisition_of_nest), Google's strong suit has never been producing _consumer_ hardware of the highest quality. This could very well be an attempt to correct this situation.

Other than that, I've noticed that there seems to be a general concern all over the Internet regarding [Nest's privacy policies going forward](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/13/nest-says-customer-data-from-devices-will-only-be-used-for-nest-products-and-services/), i.e: whether they will be forced to share their customers' data with Google. Some even go as far as to suggest that this is the actual reason behind the acquisition. I agree with most of it and for the most part, I think the concern is justified given Google's history. However, I also wonder why we're all so concerned whenever Google tries to acquire new data sources to drive their ad-targeting technology, and yet we seem to turn a blind eye when other companies do the same. Facebook, for example, knows a great deal more about their users than Google, and not only do their users provide this information voluntarily, but they actually encourage others to do so as well.

I wonder how Facebook managed to sneak so much into our lives, and I also wonder what will happen to it when (not if) their user base finally awakens to this and realizes just how much of their lives they're sharing with the service.
