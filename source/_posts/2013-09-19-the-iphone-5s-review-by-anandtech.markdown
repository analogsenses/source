Anand Lal Shimpi reviews the iPhone 5S in mind-blowing detail, like only he can. Very impressive review.



<blockquote>From a CPU and GPU standpoint, the 5s is probably the most futureproof of any iPhone ever launched. As much as it pains me to use the word futureproof, if you are one of those people who likes to hold onto their device for a while - the 5s is as good a starting point as any.</blockquote>



Who am I kidding, my wallet already feels a few hundred dollars lighter.
