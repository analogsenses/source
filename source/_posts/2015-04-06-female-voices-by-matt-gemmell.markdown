Matt Gemmell:

> I invite you to bring some balance back to your perception of the world around you, and to push past the historically male-centric gathering of voices. I started by simply following more women on Twitter, and making a conscious effort to amplify those women when the opportunity arose. The [list of people I follow](http://twitter.com/mattgemmell/following) now has more female faces than male, and I can’t adequately tell you how much of a relief that is. You should find out for yourself, and maybe use that list as a starting point.

I love this idea. We really need to hear more female voices on the Internet, and it all starts with the people we actively choose to follow. 

By the way, if you still haven’t subscribed to [Matt’s weekly email newsletter](http://mattgemmell.com/membership/#the-newsletter), I don’t even know what to tell you. He’s downright killing it week in, week out.
