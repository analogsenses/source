Kim Bellware, writing for the _Huffington Post_:

> Thirty years ago, a spiky-haired little boy set a trap with a tuna fish sandwich, and one of the most iconic friendships in comic strip history was born. 

> The first strip of “Calvin And Hobbes” ran on Nov. 18, 1985, introducing the world to the mischievous young Calvin ([named](http://www.calvinandhobbes.com/about-calvin-and-hobbes) for the 16th-century theologian) and his pet tiger Hobbes (named for the 17th-century philosopher).
