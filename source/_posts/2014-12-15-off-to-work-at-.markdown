Jeremy Foo tells the story of how, after four years of trying, he managed to get a development job at Apple:

> The code review was brutal. The author of _UITableView_ eviscerated every decision I made in the design of that piece of work. It was pretty obvious that at that moment, everything was a bust. What I also did realise was also how high the bar was and that I had a lot of work to do.

Great story. I just hope he cleared it with someone at Apple before publishing the article. Otherwise, I don't imagine they'll be too happy about those pictures being made public by a new recruit.
