[Amazon launches Cloud Drive and Cloud Player, the first digital music locker in the cloud | TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/28/amazon-cloud-drive-player/)


<blockquote>Cloud Drive is the name Amazon is giving to its media storage space on their servers. They give you 5 GB of storage for free and allow you to access the media from any computer. Cloud Player is the name of yes, the actual player. And it comes in two flavors: a player for the web, and one for Android devices. You’ll note an absence of an iOS player…</blockquote>


Finally it is Amazon who makes the first move. After the myriad of rumors, topped-up by the [Benjamin Corollary](http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/23/apple-data-center-dreamin/), we finally have a legitimate cloud-music solution, and it is not by Apple.

The exclusion of iOS compatibility (for now) is not really significant, in my opinion. If it proves to be a profitable service, Amazon will want to drive some music purchases away from iTunes, and for that they need to reach the millions of iOS users out there. There's already [a workaround](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/28/amazon-cloud-player-ios/) to play the songs through Mobile Safari, and 10 bucks say an iOS version of the Cloud Player app will be announced shortly.

For those of you who have access to [Spotify](http://spotify.com), remember that this is a service in which _you actually own_ your music, and don't just pay for access to it. It's easy to overlook that difference, but it is an important one.
