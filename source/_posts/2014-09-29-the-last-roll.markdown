The Last Roll is a great short film about the end of slide film development:

> At the end of February 2014, Orms, one of the most well known professional photography stores and film processors in Cape Town, stopped processing slide film (called the E6 process). Two photographers were asked to use the last few rolls of slide film to be processed here. While there, we met another photographer who only shot on slide film. This is their story about the end of slide film.
