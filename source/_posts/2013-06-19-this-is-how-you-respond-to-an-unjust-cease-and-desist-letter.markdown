<blockquote>When retainer attorneys employed by Big Deals send out scary cease and desist letters to nobodies on behalf of their Super Important clients, it's typically a pro forma matter.

That is to say, they don't expect to hear back.

And they certainly don't expect the Small Fry recipient to lawyer up and send out a takedown letter of his own.</blockquote>
