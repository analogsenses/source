Fuji has been pretty busy lately. The company made arguably the biggest splash at Photokina 2016 by announcing an entire new Medium Format system, including the new GFX camera and an astonishing _six_ lenses, to be released over the next few months.

These were by far the most sought-after announcements at Photokina — after all, it's not every day that you get to play with a 50-Megapixel Medium Format beast. Naturally, hands-on time was _extremely_ limited, even more so considering the camera  — and yes, there was only one camera — is still a pre-production unit.

Unfortunately I didn't manage to get my hands on the GFX, but for what it's worth, it looks like an impressive system. It's certainly bigger and bulkier than Hasselblad's new X1D camera, but if Fuji's price claims — well under $10k for the camera with one lens — end up being true, it will also be significantly more affordable. In fact, the GFX has the potential to bring Medium Format digital photography into a more approachable area for the first time. Each company's offering appears to have its fair share of strengths and weaknesses, so we'll see which one will resonate more with prospective customers. The game is most definitely on.
