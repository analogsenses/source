Brett Howse, writing for _AnandTech_:

> The 850 Pro retails for $1000, and the 850 EVO retails for $800. Although not inexpensive by any means, and still much more than the $75 of a spinning disk, the prices are right around double the 1TB models in the lineup so there is not any extra premium to get the larger models at this time.

$800 is a lot of money, but if you need an SSD, theyâ€™re worth every penny.
