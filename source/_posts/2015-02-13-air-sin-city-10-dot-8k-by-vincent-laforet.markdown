Vincent Laforet is back at it. After [his jaw-droppingly gorgeous images of New York City](https://www.storehouse.co/stories/r3rcy-air-gotham-7-5k), this time he goes to Las Vegas to give us an amazing bird’s eye look at the city of sin.

Better yet, [he’s taking his AIR series worldwide](https://www.storehouse.co/air), which means he’ll be coming to Europe in the next few months. I can’t wait to see how he captures the magic of this side of the pond.
