Mikael Colville-Andersen is on a roll:

> **4. Criminalize Walking**  
> With simple legislation your community, too, can clamp down on humans moving unaided by fossil fuels through your paradisical motorised world. [Follow the lead of this New Jersey town](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/05/texting-while-walking-banned-in-new-jersey-town/) and ban texting while walking and reduce exponentially the irritating dents caused by human bones striking the smooth, elegant paint jobs of your citizens' cars. If only we had thought of this back when people walked around reading newspapers in cities. Damn.

> At the same time, you can [go all Spanish on your population's asses and ban Drunk Walking](http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/25/spain-wants-to-ban-drunk-walking-what-next-for-pedestrians?CMP=share_btn_tw). Laugh in the face of those who suggest restricting cars or lowering speed limits in densely-populated nightlife districts and keep your police force fresh and battle-ready by enforcing this sensible law.

Looking at the bright side: if they ever do ban drunk walking, our only legal option will be to just stay in the bar forever.
