[With Google, There Will Be Bad Blood | TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/08/06/ive-abandoned-my-boy/)


<blockquote>But why? Why is Google now a villain to many in the industry? I don’t believe it’s because they’re evil, I believe it simply relates to the Plainview quote. Increasingly, Google is trying to do everything. And they have the arrogance to think that they can. And it’s pissing people off.</blockquote>
