With Josh unable to join us this week, Marius and I catch up on the news, and then I share some of the _many_ things I learned during my recent trip to Lisbon, including my impressions on the Sony Zeiss FE 16-35mm F4 lens. Along the way, we also answer a listener question, chastise Zenfolio for terrible behavior, discuss photo backups for travel, and I get to make my first-ever baseball reference on the show.
