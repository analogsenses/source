Tonight [Deep Rising](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118956/) was on TV. It didn't ring a bell, so I went to IMDb to check out a few reviews. Sure enough, Neonsamurai's was the first one, with the title: "It's officially the best film ever made":

> The sad thing is that if the Colour Purple had included a raid on a sinking cruise liner, infested with sub aqua monsters as part of the film, then it too would have climbed to the top of my favourite movie list. But as with most films the director took the easy way out and chose to ignore this very overlooked area of filmmaking. 

I honestly don't know how it's taken me this long to run into his reviews (Deep Rising's is from 2002). After that, I obviously had to take a look at the rest of them.

Great, great stuff.
