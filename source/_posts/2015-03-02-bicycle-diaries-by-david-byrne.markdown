I came across this book while doing some research for a bicycle-related photography project I’m dreaming up for the next few months. From the [official website](http://www.davidbyrne.com/archive/art/books/bicycle_diaries/):

> Since the early 1980s, David has been riding a bike as his principal means of transportation in New York City. Two decades ago, he discovered folding bikes and started taking them with him when travelling around the world. DB's choice was initially made out of convenience rather than political motivation, but the more cities he saw from his bicycle, the more he became hooked on this mode of transport and the sense of liberation, exhilaration, and connection it provided. This point of view, from his bike seat, became his panoramic window on urban life, a magical way of opening one’s eyes to the inner workings and rhythms of a city’s geography and population.

I ordered it on Amazon as soon as I read that. I have a feeling this is going to be a great read. Stay tuned for more detailed commentary; I’ll probably have a _lot_ to say when I’m done reading it.
