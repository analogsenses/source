Josh is back in the reviewer’s seat, and boy did he do it in style. This great, in-depth review not only covers the Retina iMac’s features, but also _why_ you should consider owning one, especially if you have an interest in photography:

> Generally speaking, I’m willing to bet the majority of people in the market for a Retina iMac will be in the market as a hobbyist or professional. Sure, every element looks better than ever on this display, but the true potential of the 5K Retina iMac is in maximizing the precision and control over visual content. Any photographer looking to improve their images should take a long, hard look at any Retina iMac model. The resolution of the display alone is worth the money, and that doesn’t take into consideration the pixel perfect colouration across the screen.

I’m not ashamed to admit it: I would probably sell a few of my less-vital organs for a Retina iMac. There, I said it.
