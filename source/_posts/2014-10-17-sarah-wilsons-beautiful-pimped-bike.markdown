> My bike is the most valuable material possession I own, [apart from my couch](http://www.sarahwilson.com/2014/03/how-to-buy-the-most-sustainable-sofa-ever/), if we’re talking from a financial POV. From an attachment POV, my bike is number one by a mile.

> I’m attached. The reason is this…it represents a story and a process. Allow me to share the story (it does have a point).

I totally get where she's coming from. There's something special about an object with a past life going back decades. It's a feeling you won't find on a new bicycle, no matter how much you spend. Classic road bikes from the 70's or so are incredible feats of craftsmanship. Those things were built to last a lifetime, and many of them are still actively being used every day. 

I'd much prefer to put $500 towards restoring a classic, handmade italian frame than spending them on a new bike.

Come to think of it, [I actually did](https://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/8611214608/). But that's a story for another day.
