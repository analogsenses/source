Matthew Inman:

> When discussing self-driving cars, people tend to ask a lot of superficial questions: _how much will these cars cost? Is this supposed to replace my car at home? Is this supposed to replace taxis or Uber? What if I need to use a drive-thru?_

> They ignore the smarter questions. They ignore the fact that 45% of disabled people in the US still work. They ignore the fact that 95% of a car's lifetime is spent parked. They ignore how this technology could transform the lives of the elderly, or eradicate the need for parking lots or garages or gas stations. They dismiss the entire concept because they don't think a computer could ever be as good at merging on the freeway as they are. 

> They ignore the great, big, beautiful picture staring them right in the face: that this technology could make our lives so much _better_.

There are still many kinks to iron out, but these cars already sound pretty damn impressive, and their potential is truly exciting.
