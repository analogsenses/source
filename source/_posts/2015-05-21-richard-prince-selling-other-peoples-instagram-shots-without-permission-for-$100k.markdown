Michael Zhang, writing at _Peta Pixel_:

> Artist Richard Prince is notorious in the art world for taking other people’s work, “appropriating” them as his own with various changes, and then selling them for large amounts of dough. His latest endeavor is once again raising eyebrows: Prince is selling other people’s Instagram photos for up to $100,000 _each_.

> In a gallery exhibition titled “New Portraits,” which [ran at the Gagosian Gallery](http://www.gagosian.com/exhibitions/richard-prince--september-19-2014) in NYC from September through October 2014, Prince displayed 38 portraits featuring photos taken from his Instagram feeds — other people’s images, and without permission.

It’s things like this that make me wish I had a “Jackass of the Year” award to give away.
