[The Merry Stormtrooper | An A List Apart Column](http://alistapart.com/column/the-merry-stormtrooper)

Nishant Kothary, a former Microsoft employee, has an interesting view on they key to success:



<blockquote>The secret, as Mihaly discovered by studying all types of people in the flow state, lies in setting achievable goals that are just a wee bit out of reach. The kind of goals that will require you to stretch yourself and grow in order to achieve them. And when you meet them? Raise the stakes, and repeat. That’s it.

This is a profoundly simple concept in theory. But as the saying goes, “In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, they are different.” And it’s because it’s always easier said than done.</blockquote>



Very sound advice. If you have the time, read it. If you don't, read it anyway.
