Chris Bowler: 

> The fact that our culture attempts to identify humans as _consumers_ is a terrible reality. But if we all make conscious choices to buy quality items — ones we will use and ones that will last — and for which the human beings who are involved in the creation process are paid and treated appropriately, we’ll make this world a little better.

I'm really liking the new focus and direction of Tools and Toys.
