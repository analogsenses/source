These days it seems there are so many great podcasts it's almost impossible to keep up with all of them. Lately I'm making a conscious effort to discover new shows, and I recently ran into one of the truly great ones: [The Incomparable](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/), hosted by Jason Snell. 

I love the feeling you get when you discover something really awesome —and popular!— that you had no idea even existed. At episode 212, The Incomparable is a veteran show and it features some of the very best podcasters on a regular basis. In this episode alone, you get to listen to Andy Ihnatko, John Siracusa, Merlin Mann, Steve Lutz, David J. Loehr and, of course, Mr. Jason Snell himself.

And that's not even the best part. They're going to do a sweep of all the Pixar movies, and they're starting with [Toy Story](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0114709/).

If there's a better way to get introduced to a new podcast, I can't think of it.
