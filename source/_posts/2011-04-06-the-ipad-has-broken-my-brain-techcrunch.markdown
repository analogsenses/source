[The iPad Has Broken My Brain | TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/06/the-ipad-os-x-scrolling/)


<blockquote>It’s like my brain is locked in. I’m someone who has had an iPad for a year, but I’ve never used it for days in a row without touching a computer like I just did this weekend. And it seems to have re-wired my brain.</blockquote>


It's the billion-dollar question: What's so special about the iPad? This is something that's impossible to understand unless you actually hold one in your hands and use it for a while: It changes everything. It changes the way you interact with computers. It changes you. Forever.

Starting with Mac OS X Lion, the behavior of two-finger scrolling will be reversed to match that of iOS devices. Why? Simply because it is more natural. It's how it **always** should have been. But we needed iOS to learn that.

The good news? Scrolling is just the beginning; a global re-wiring has already started. It will affect the entirety of our computing experience, and there's no stopping it.
