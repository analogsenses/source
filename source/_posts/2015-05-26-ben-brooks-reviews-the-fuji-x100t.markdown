What a fantastic review by Ben Brooks. Over the past year, Ben gradually reduced his photography gear down to what ultimately worked best _for him_:

> I am now all in on the X100T and what I can tell you right now is that it is a wonderful camera. I truly love it. My plan isn’t to make any hard and fast decisions over whether this was a smart move for another 5-6 months. With a one year roll up on shooting with just one focal length.

> However, what I can tell you right now is that this is one of the best cameras I have ever owned, and it is quickly becoming my favorite camera I have ever owned.

I love how he went through the discovery process, and I also love how he kept an open mind all the way through. The Fuji X100T looks like an amazing camera and if I were in the market for a 35mm equivalent fixed-lens camera, it would be a total no-brainer.
