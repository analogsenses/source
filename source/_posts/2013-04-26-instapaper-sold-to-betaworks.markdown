This was even more surprising than WWDC selling out in under two minutes:



<blockquote>I’m happy to announce that I’ve sold a majority stake in Instapaper to Betaworks. We’ve structured the deal with Instapaper’s health and longevity as the top priority, with incentives to keep it going well into the future. I will continue advising the project indefinitely, while Betaworks will take over its operations, expand its staff, and develop it further.</blockquote>



I'm genuinely happy for Marco. He's done a terrific job with Instapaper, and now he knows it's time for him to move on. That takes courage. I have the utmost respect for him, and I truly wish him the best for the future.

Thanks for everything, Marco.
