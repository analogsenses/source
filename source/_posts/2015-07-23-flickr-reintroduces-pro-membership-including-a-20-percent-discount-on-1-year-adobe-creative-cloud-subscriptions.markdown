Flickr reintroduced their Pro membership today, with a special offer that includes a 20% discount during the first year of new Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions:

> Save 20% on Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan in the first year

> Get the photography tools you need to make the moment yours: Adobe Photoshop CC and Lightroom CC. Edit, enhance, and transform your photos on any device, anywhere.

> To purchase Adobe Creative Cloud Photography plan and learn about any changes to the expiration date visit: [https://creative.adobe.com/promo/FlickrCCPP?sdid=KSYZU&flickrid=ejebureulm](https://creative.adobe.com/promo/FlickrCCPP?sdid=KSYZU&flickrid=ejebureulm).

This is a great offer, but it’s only valid for new Creative Cloud subscriptions, not existing ones. There’s also a shipping discount on photo books and wall art as part of the new Pro membership deal:

> As a Pro member, you'll receive free standard shipping in the US and 50% off international standard shipping. Minimum purchase of $25 required.

I’ve been a Flickr Pro member since 2010, back when the original Pro membership was available. The great thing about this is that long-standing Pro memberships like mine were automatically upgraded to the new features, but maintain their original pricing of $24.95/year, instead of the new pricing of $5.99/month or $49.99/year. This was a classy move from Yahoo.

The reason I maintained my Pro membership even when Flickr switched pricing tiers and gave everyone a free TB of storage is that I really enjoy the service and I’m happy to pay for it to remove ads from my timeline. Now that I got all the features of the new Pro membership at the same price I’ve always paid, I’m definitely not complaining for not being able to benefit from the Creative Cloud special offer.

Flickr keeps fighting to stay relevant in the age of Facebook and Instagram and I, for one, couldn’t be happier about it.
