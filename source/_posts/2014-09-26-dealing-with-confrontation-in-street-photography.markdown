> Several months back, a reader emailed us about how to [avoid confrontation](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/03/26/reader-question-avoid-getting-punched-nose-street-photography/) in street photography. Up until that point and beyond, I had successfully photographed without incident. That, however, has changed. I was walking up towards the train when I saw this man with his cat. I knelt down to get a photo on their level and made two images before inching slightly closer to get a tighter frame. He looked up just as I made the shot, and thatâ€™s when it all went wrong.

There a few things you should always keep in mind when taking pictures of strangers on the street.
