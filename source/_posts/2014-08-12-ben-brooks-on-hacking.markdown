<blockquote>The point of all this is that you should never be afraid to hack away at things. I still hack away at the CSS on this site, and while the site is live I save the change and see what happens. Maybe the entire site dies because of that, or maybe it doesn’t — I don’t care. I don’t care because I am working at learning and those few minutes of a broken site won’t really matter to anyone in the long run, but it _will_ help me immensely.</blockquote>

Ben's right on the money here. Which reminds me, there's a bit of Wordpress hacking I need to do on this site myself.[footnote]I'm not entirely happy with how the link-formatted posts are being handled by the Wordpress engine. Right now, I need to manually add an "external-link" tag to the title of each post in order for it to be styled appropriately. I'm trying to find a way to automate the process, so that it's easier for me to publish these posts.[/footnote]external-url:
