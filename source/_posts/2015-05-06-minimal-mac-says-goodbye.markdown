Patrick Rhone:

> This is the final post on Minimal Mac. This project contains what I believe in when it comes to a mindful and intentional approach to technology. After nearly 2,500 posts, I have nothing more to add to what has already been said. As I wrote in my book _enough_, [saying no is actually saying yes to other things](http://www.enoughbook.com/say-no-say-yes/). It’s time to say “no” to this project so that I can say “yes” to others (or, in some cases, fully commit to agreements already made).

> For those who have read and enjoyed this site at any time over the nearly six year span, I thank you and hope it has truly helped you in a meaningful way.

It’s impossible to overstate how important Patrick’s work on _Minimal Mac_ has been to me, personally. It is no exaggeration to say that without _Minimal Mac_, _Analog Senses_ would not exist as we know it today.

Patrick’s work played a huge part in the decision to start my own website [back in 2009](http://www.analogsenses.com/2009/11/10/239397612/) — when we still used the word _weblog_ — and he’s been a constant source of guidance and inspiration ever since. Today, I am proud to call him my friend, and I wish him nothing but the very best for what’s coming. If there’s one guy who deserves it, it’s him.

You did great Patrick, and your work will endure. You can move on without regret. Thanks for everything, and see you on the road.

Onward!
