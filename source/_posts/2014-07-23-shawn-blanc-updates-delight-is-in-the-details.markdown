[ Shawn Blanc updates "Delight is in the Details"](https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/)



<blockquote>Delight is in the Details is packed with practical advice, tips, encouragement, inspiration, and insight. Resist the prevailing tide of “good enough” work that leads to forgettable products and a dissatisfaction in your work life. This book and interview series will teach you how how to reach for excellence and find joy and delight in the journey.

Shawn's excellent bundle for people who make things includes an ebook, an audiobook, an interview series, videos and much more. It's also on sale for the next 24 hours, so grab one while they're hot.

For the past weeks I've been getting a few preview emails from Shawn with bits and pieces of the new stuff and let me assure you, the update is _massive_. By itself, the new content alone would easily justify buying the entire kit again. However, if you've already bought Delight is in the Details you won't need to spend another dime to get the update. 

That's a seriously classy move, but then again this is Shawn we're talking about. I would expect nothing less.
