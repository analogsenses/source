Fantastic essay by Richard J. Anderson:

> Instead of success stories, I want to hear from people who failed, especially if they failed by doing the “right” thing. We have more to learn from those who lost the lottery than we do from those who won.

I'm also playing the lottery here. I like to think that every day I show up is like purchasing a new ticket and the more tickets I get, the better my chances of eventually winning. I've found this helps me a great deal in overcoming the uncertainty of not knowing if/when things will change.
