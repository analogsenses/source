<blockquote>I must say, @color is great to whip out at a party if you want to feel like a real-life version of a New Yorker joke.</blockquote>


The resemblance is so remarkable that it's hard to believe  it's only a coincidence. Something tells me it's not great for your app to be compared to a New Yorker joke right after its debut, but hey, what do I know.

Or the 131 (and counting) people who left [one-star reviews](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color/id427763573?mt=8&ls=1) on the App Store. That's 67% of all the reviews. But it's surely because they just don't get it.
