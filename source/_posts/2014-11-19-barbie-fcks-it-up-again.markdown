Pamela Ribon takes Susan Marenco to the woodshed on account of [her new Barbie double-book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0449816192/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0449816192&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=RU6KZWIRCLVSSL6I), titled _"I can be an Actress / I can be a Computer Engineer":_

> THE FUCKING END, PEOPLE.

> Despite having ruined her own laptop, her sister’s laptop, and the library’s computers, not to mention Steven and Brian’s afternoon, she takes full credit for her game design– only to get extra credit and decide she’s an awesome computer engineer! “I did it all by myself!”

Wait, there's more:

> When you hold the book in your hands to read a story, the opposite book is upside down, facing out. So the final insult to this entire literary disaster is that when you read “Barbie: I Can Be a Computer Engineer,” it appears that you are so fucking dumb, you’re reading “Barbie: I Can Be an Actress” upside down.
