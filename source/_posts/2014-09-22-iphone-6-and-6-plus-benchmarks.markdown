Speaking of Rene Ritchie, he asked the makers of Geekbench to run the new iPhones through Geekbench 3, and compared their score with all previous iPhones (except for the original iPhone and the iPhone 3G). He also compared them with their main Android competitors.

An interesting tidbit:

> The iPhone 6 Plus has a slight edge over the iPhone 6, but not by much. Perhaps the biggest surprise is how well the iPhone 5s still holds up. Perhaps that's because Apple's second-generation 64-bit core is just that, 2nd generation, and it's focused on things beyond raw power, like power efficiency.

If you have an iPhone 5S and are not very keen on the bigger displays of the new iPhones, this is good news for you.
