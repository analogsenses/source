I have long been a fan of paperless work practices. Doing everything we can to minimize our paper trail is important: there are many benefits — instantly searchable archives, for one — and absolutely zero disadvantages, so trying to avoid filling our offices with dead trees is pretty much a no-brainer for me.

This great guide over at Tools & Toys gives you everything you need to get started on the transition to a pristine, paperless office. Of course, the real dream would be to not generate any paper to begin with, but unfortunately this is not yet feasible in todays’s world.
