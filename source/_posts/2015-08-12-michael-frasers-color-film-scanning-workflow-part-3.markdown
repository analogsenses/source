The third and final part of Michael Fraser’s DSLR-based color negative film scanning workflow was published yesterday, and it’s amazing. I’ve recently been asking Michael for help on Twitter in order to fine-tune my own workflow, which is based on his previous articles, and he’s been incredibly helpful and nice. The tweaks he’s made in this final post make all the difference in the world, and the included screencast is super informative and easy to follow. 100% recommended.
