For the past 24 hours, the entire Internet has been up in arms over a dress. More specifically, over _the color_ of a dress. I kid you not. Here’s [the offending image](http://swiked.tumblr.com/post/112073818575/guys-please-help-me-is-this-dress-white-and):

The other half, however, are just as passionate when they claim the dress is blue and black. Whatever camp you’re in, something is off.
