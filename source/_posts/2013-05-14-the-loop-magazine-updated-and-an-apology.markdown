[The Loop Magazine updated and an apology](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/05/13/the-loop-magazine-updated-and-an-apology/)

Jim Dalrymple, on the subscription bug that plagued the first two releases of the excellent [The Loop Magazine](http://www.loopinsight.com/2013/05/09/the-loop-magazine-for-iphone-and-ipad-released/) app: 



<blockquote>You deserved a better experience than what we delivered, and we expected more from ourselves. Please accept my apology and know that we are working hard to deliver a great app for you.</blockquote>



Relax Jim, you're trying too hard. Bugs in 1.0 versions are not uncommon, and easily forgivable. Especially when developers react timely and work their asses off to release an update. And yes, even if the update doesn't immediately fix the problem, there's still no harm done. As the saying goes: "[If at first you don't succeed...](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Edward_Hickson)"

We don't expect you guys to be perfect, we just expect you to be professional and respectful towards your customers. And in my book, you certainly have.
