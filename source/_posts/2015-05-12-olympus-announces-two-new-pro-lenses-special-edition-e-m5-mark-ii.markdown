Olympus officially unveiled a lot of cool stuff today, to be released by the end of June:

* The [Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 7-14mm f/2.8 PRO](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WENHU6S/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00WENHU6S&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=JQROAH3T66ZEJ4WE) zoom lens, which completes their Pro zoom lineup and offers all of the same advantages of its longer siblings. More information [on the Olympus site](http://www.olympus-global.com/en/news/2015a/nr150512zuikoe.jsp).

* The [Olympus M.Zuiko Digital ED 8mm f1.8 Fisheye PRO](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WENHV2G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00WENHV2G&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=VNLIKW4Q4GXAOPH2) lens, which is the widest high-end prime for the system with a 180-degree diagonal angle of view.

* The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II Limited Edition, which comes in a Titanium color — reminiscent of the classic OM-3T/Ti from 1994 — and bundled with a premium leather strap, leather card case, and numbered owner's card. It comes in a kit with the Olympus 14-150mm f4.0-5.6 lens, and it will be limited to 7,000 units worldwide.

All in all, it’s been an interesting day for Olympus owners. Every item announced seems to continue the excellent run Olympus has been in for the past few years and if the rumors are anything to go by, it doesn’t look like they’re planning to stop anytime soon.
