Alan Taylor: 

> I'd like to introduce our readers to _The Atlantic_'s new [Photo section](http://theatlantic.com/photo), an expanded home for photography at TheAtlantic.com. This new section features not only an updated look, but more variety in formats, wider images for bigger screens, and a design that works well across a range of mobile devices.

> As the editor of the Photo section, I'll continue to publish long-form photo essays nearly every day, as I have for years, in a series we'll still call In Focus, but I'll also start publishing shorter posts—often just a single noteworthy image—under a new category we're calling Burst. I'm really excited to be able to share even more high-quality photography with even more readers.

Great new section, but the full-page popover ads on _every_ page refresh are just heinous.
