Exciting news from Myke Hurley and Stephen Hackett. Personally, I can’t wait to check out [Reconcilable Differences](http://relay.fm/rd):

> First up we have [Reconcilable Differences](http://relay.fm/rd), featuring [Merlin Mann](http://twitter.com/hotdogsladies) and [John Siracusa](http://twitter.com/siracusa). We are thrilled to welcome these two podcasting powerhouses to Relay FM, and we are so happy with how this show is shaping up. On each episode of Reconcilable Differences, you'll get to hear John and Merlin prod at each other’s backgrounds as fans of technology and pop culture, filling in holes, arguing minor differences, and generally teaching each other about the things they both love.

This is going to be so much fun.
