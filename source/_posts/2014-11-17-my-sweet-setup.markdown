This week I was invited to do an interview over at The Sweet Setup about the tools and gear I use every day. I think it went pretty well, and I hope you find it interesting.

If you were curious to see how the magic happens, this is your chance.

P.S. To me it's a great honor to be featured in The Sweet Setup. Many of my favorite people on the Internet have done this interview in the past, and I'm thrilled to now be a small part of that awesome community.
