Hello there, welcome to this special, to go edition of _Morning Coffee_. 

Life’s been particularly busy around these parts lately, and I’m afraid I’ll continue to be pressed for time for the next few days at least. As a result, there will be no essay this week, and instead I’ll leave you with the usual selection of some of the best pieces of writing on the Internet — and yes, that’s Internet with a capital “I”.

It’s important to keep a flexible enough work schedule. That will help you accommodate most changes without disrupting your plans, most of the time. It’s just a smart thing to do, and provides some extra peace of mind. I always try to do that.

Eventually, however, a day will come when circumstances change beyond your control and/or ability to anticipate those changes, and you’ll have to adapt. And sometimes, you’ll need to accept there’s nothing you can do about it. Learning to be OK with that can be quite difficult, but it’s also a very valuable skill, as it allows you to keep your eye on the ball despite the occasional hiccup.

I suppose there’s a lesson to be learned from that.
 

##Issue \#43: Motorcycle-proof cameras and the death of the Internet

No animals, domestic or otherwise, were harmed in the selection of these pieces. Enjoy responsibly.

###[The Day the Internet Became “internet” | Alyssa Bereznak →](https://theringer.com/the-day-the-internet-became-internet-9d884194abe3#.i4etjwvau)

The Associated Press has now officially changed their _AP Stylebook_ to de-capitalize the words “internet”, and “web”. Moreover, many important publications, including _The New York Times_, have announced they will follow suit. No offense, but the AP, the NYT, and whoever else has a problem with capitalizing the Internet can kiss my ass on this one.

###[Crafting My Home Office | Ben Brooks →](https://brooksreview.net/2016/06/home-office/)

Great piece from Ben on how important it is to ruthlessly defend your working space. I wholeheartedly agree — and by the way: nice office, Ben.

###[Two and a half years, 13 countries, 1 camera: The Leica M Review | Sebastiaan de With →](https://medium.com/@sdw/two-and-a-half-years-13-countries-1-camera-the-leica-m-review-6fb09b84d8b3#.l6vbg6f2h)

This is without a doubt the best Leica M review you’ll see on the Web — see what I did there?

In fact, this review is so good that it had me looking at used Leica M3’s on eBay for a good long while after I finished reading it. And if you’re a [Candid](http://www.candid.fm) listener, you know I don’t say that lightly.

###[Rafael Nadal a victim of his own mental and physical strengths | Greg Garber →](http://espn.go.com/tennis/french16/story/_/id/12187672)

Rafael Nadal is one of the best tennis players ever, but his incredibly physical playing style has been taking a tremendous toll on his body for many years now, and he may be close to breaking down for good.

###[Comparisons? Golden State Warriors Are Playing a Different Game | Harvey Araton →](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/01/sports/basketball/golden-state-warriors-oklahoma-city-thunder-nba-playoffs.html)

The Warriors are making history, and there are two very good reasons for that: Stephen Curry and Klay Thompson.

###[Star Wars Episode IV in one picture | Martin Panchaud →](http://swanh.net)

This bonus link for the week was absolutely brilliant.

##Afterword

Just like the foreword, I’m afraid the afterword will have to be cut short this week. Life permitting, the usual Morning Coffee format will be back next week. Until then, have a wonderful Sunday, and thank you for reading.
