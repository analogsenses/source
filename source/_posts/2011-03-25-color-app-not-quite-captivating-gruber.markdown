<blockquote>This thing looks like a turd to me. Now, maybe I’m the idiot and the joke’s on me and Color is going to be a huge hit. But my figurative money says that the investors who funded these guys just flushed $41 million in literal money down the toilet.</blockquote>


Brutally harsh critique by Gruber of the new iPhone app that has managed to grab everyone's attention today. On paper, it looks to me like there could be a great idea hiding there somewhere, but I trust John's instinct. They must have done a number of things awfully wrong to get him pissed off _that_ bad.
