So true.

Ladies and gentlemen, it’s my pleasure to introduce you to Field Notes, the journal that gives my Moleskine a heck of a run for its money. Thanks to [@moleskinny](http://twitter.com/moleskinny/status/16157304740) for the heads up!

I’ve always been a fan of the notebook. Even in the digital era, some thoughts are just meant to be written down on paper.

On a related note, you may want to have a look at this:
