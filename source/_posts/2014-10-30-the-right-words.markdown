Patrick Rhone is on fire lately:

> It is moments like this that I am reminded why I am a writer. Iâ€™m in love with and in awe of the power of language. The way a single word or just the right ones strung together can capture the whole of something otherwise only imagined. An entire experience can be encapsulated, examined, and then set free for others to bear witness to, all in an instant, with just three simple words.
