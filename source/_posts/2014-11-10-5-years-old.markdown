description: "Analog Senses turns five years old today"
---

Dear readers,

Today, Analog Senses turns five years old. I'd like to take a moment to thank those who have been reading since the very beginning, and to welcome the many of you that have recently joined. Without you, what I do here wouldn't mean anything. From the very bottom of my heart, _thank you._

These are [interesting times](/2014/09/15/catharsis/) for Analog Senses. A lot has changed since [the early days](/2009/11/10/238565026/), but my passion and dedication for this site have never been stronger. I'm convinced its brightest days lie ahead, and I'm deeply honored to have you along for the ride.

I can't wait to see what the next five years look like.

My best,  
√Ålvaro.
