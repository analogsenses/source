The folks at [Peak Design](https://peakdesign.com) are back with yet another massively successful Kickstarter project. This time, they set out to design and create the perfect camera bag, not only for photographers, but for everyone else, too:

> The Everyday Messenger™ is a beautiful, intelligent and adaptable messenger bag designed around the workflows of photographers, creatives, travelers and commuters. **It’s more than a camera bag, it’s your day-to-day essential carry workhorse**, and it does things other camera bags can’t.

Of course they’re the ones selling the bag, so take their enthusiastic words with a grain of salt. Still, I have to say, the design does look awesome, and I love the many clever features that are seamlessly integrated into the bag.

I’ll definitely be keeping an eye on this project, and will probably end up supporting it before it ends. It’s not like they need the help — they’re already at $1.8 million, almost 20x their initial goal — but it is a great way to ensure more awesome Kickstarter projects keep coming.

Also, check out the video below to get more information about the bag’s design. Great stuff:
