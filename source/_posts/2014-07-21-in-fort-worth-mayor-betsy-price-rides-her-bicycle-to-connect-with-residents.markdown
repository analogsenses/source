Good for her:


<blockquote>The mayor regularly swoops into the city’s disparate neighborhoods on her bike to conduct “rolling town-hall meetings,” taking City Hall to the people. Residents bike up next to her to discuss a variety of issues and grievances, like zoning, potholes and trash pickup.</blockquote>



This really ought to be a common practice for Mayors all over the world. It's also a pretty smart strategy to engage with residents: I have found it is very difficult to be angry when riding a bicycle.
