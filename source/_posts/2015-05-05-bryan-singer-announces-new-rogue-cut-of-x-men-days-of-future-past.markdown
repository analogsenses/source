Bryan Singer [took to Periscope](https://t.co/IkIsLLudGr) today to announce a new alternate cut of _X-Men: Days of Future Past_, to be released on July 17. The new cut is 17 minutes longer and was dubbed ‘The Rogue Cut’, because it includes several additional scenes involving the Rogue character, played by Anna Paquin.

I actually think this new cut could be an improvement over the theatrical version of the film. For some reason, when I watched the original cut at the theater it kind of felt as though some scenes were missing, almost as if they’d been cut in order to keep the theatrical version from running too long. 

I’m really looking forward to seeing what the new scenes are, and how they impact the overall plot but really, just about any excuse to get more of Fassbender as Magneto will do.
