My review of the [Sony FE 70-200mm F4 G OSS](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00I8BICEO/?tag=analogsens-20) lens was published yesterday on _Tools & Toys_.

This lens is a bit of an odd creature. On paper, being an f/4 lens, one would expect it to be a great-but-not-quite-outstanding optical instrument. After all, the standard in the industry for professional-grade zooms is f/2.8, so that would position this lens more towards the enthusiast and amateur segments of the market.

However, once you start taking pictures with it, such narrow definitions immediately prove to be short-sighted. This lens is, simply put, a stunner. It's super sharp, renders colors beautifully, and handles like a dream. It truly is a professional-grade lens in every way, despite what conventional wisdom dictates.
