[Humans of New York](http://www.humansofnewyork.com) is a wonderful —and ongoing— collection of portraits of New Yorkers by Brandon Stanton.

New York is the greatest city in the world. I'm always in awe of its incredible energy and the uniqueness of its people. It is a place like no other to watch life unfold. Brandon's project captures this essence better than any other I've ever seen. It really is a must read.

[Humans of New York](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250038820/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1250038820&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=VXVVXTDGZJTOOG5B), the book, is a compilation of the most interesting anecdotes and pictures from the project's first three years. It showcases the greatness of New York, but more importantly, that of its people. It is a love letter to diversity and the human spirit. Above all, though, it's just a gorgeous, gorgeous book.

There's a very short list of books I'd recommend buying in hardcover edition, and this is one of them. Trust me, you will not regret it.
