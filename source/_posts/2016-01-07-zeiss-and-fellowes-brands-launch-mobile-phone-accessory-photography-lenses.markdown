Interesting news to start the year. From Zeiss’ own official press release:

> The first three lenses – wide-angle, telephoto and macro – are scheduled to be launched in late Q2 2016. The wide-angle and telephoto lenses offer excellent image performance with outstanding edge-to-edge contrast. The macro lens features a zoom function – unique for accessory lenses of this type – for flexible image composition. The new lenses can be used on the Apple iPhone with customized mounting brackets.

These will be iPhone-only at launch, but they plan to release versions compatible with other phones in the future.

I always thought add-on lenses like these were little more than a marketing gimmick, but if Zeiss is getting involved with their brand, there may be more to them than I thought. These ones certainly look the part, at the very least.

Still, I wouldn’t be interested in buying something like this, because it just seems too much hassle to be worth it, especially considering I already own and use a dedicated camera. That said, I can totally see the appeal for iPhone-only or even iPhone-first photographers.
