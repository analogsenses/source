This documentary looks amazing. One of my closest friends is a magician, and through him I've learned to appreciate and love this beautiful craft. I can't wait to see it.

By the way, seeing [Juan Tamariz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Tamariz) in the trailer made me feel quite emotional. He's a living legend, a truly beloved icon in the world of magic. I remember I used to watch him perform unbelievable tricks on TV back when I was a little kid, and I was always enchanted by his character. A couple of years ago I finally got to meet the man  — alongside my friend — and it was one of the most, well, magical experiences of my life.
