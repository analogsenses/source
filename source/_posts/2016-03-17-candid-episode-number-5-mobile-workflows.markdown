This week’s episode is all about mobile workflows: what apps and services we use — or don’t use — to shoot, edit and share pictures from our mobile devices. We also dive into the best ways to get your pictures from a dedicated camera onto your phone in order to share them on social networks. And we go over what’s already there vs what’s still missing in iOS for the iPad Pro and the Apple Pencil to become the ultimate photo editing setup.

Lots to unpack in this one, for sure.
