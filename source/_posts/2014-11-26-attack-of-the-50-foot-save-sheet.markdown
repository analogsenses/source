Jason Snell is having issues with his save sheets in Yosemite:

> This morning I tried to save a file in BBEdit, only to discover that I couldn’t see half of the save sheet—it was so large, it went off the bottom of the screen.

> It turns out—and thanks to Jon Gotow of St. Clair Software, maker of the excellent [Default Folder X](http://www.stclairsoft.com/DefaultFolderX/), for the answer to this—that there’s a bug in Yosemite that causes a sheet to grow taller by 22 pixels every time you use it.
