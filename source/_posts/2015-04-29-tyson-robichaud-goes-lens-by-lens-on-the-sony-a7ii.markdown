Nice overview of all his lenses and gorgeous accompanying photography, as always:

> This is purely a personal journey here.  A little retrospective look back at the last couple months to see what I’ve been getting out of the new Sony a7II.  I tend to spend a lot of time looking at specific things in regard to a lens or camera for the blog here, and I figured I’d compile a few shots from the combination of lenses I’ve been using.  I have mostly used my Canon EF mount lenses via the Metabones adapter ([review on that HERE](https://tysonrobichaudphotography.wordpress.com/2015/03/20/using-the-metabones-mk-4-efemount-smart-adapter-on-the-a7ii-a-user-review/)), but have recently acquired the Zeiss 55mm f/1.8 because I felt the camera deserved to also be shot with a high quality native mount lens, plus I was curious to see how it handled this new, crazy feature all the kids talk about in auto focus.
