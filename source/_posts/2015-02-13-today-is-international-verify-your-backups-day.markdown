Adam C. Engst: 

> The best defense against entropy is a good backup strategy. To quote a long-ago ad campaign from backup software maker Dantz Development, “To go forward, you must back up.”

> But as those of us who have had to rely on our backups in the past know, the act of backing up is only the first small step in the full equation — it’s being able to _restore_ that really matters.

I fully endorse this newly-minted tradition.
