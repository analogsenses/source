Matt Gemmell’s new book is out today. It’s called [Writing in Markdown](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/writing-in-markdown), and it’s the first in a new series of short books by publisher [Five Simple Steps](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/). The series is called [Fast Reads](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/blogs/news/35441605-introducing-fast-reads-a-new-series-of-books), and the idea is to create short, informative and densely packed books that are easy to read in one sitting and provide a comprehensive overview on any given topic. In Matt’s own words:

> I write every article on this site (and my articles for publication elsewhere, in magazines and online) in Markdown. All my notes are in Markdown files. My weekly [members-only newsletters](http://mattgemmell.com/membership/) begin life as Markdown files. I even think in that format.

> It was fitting, then, that I was offered the opportunity to write a Fast Read – the first in the series, no less – about using Markdown. I gladly accepted, and I’m pleased to announce that the book is now available.

> It’s called [Writing in Markdown](http://www.fivesimplesteps.com/products/writing-in-markdown), it’s about 5,000 words long, and you can read it cover-to-cover in around twenty minutes. It costs £2.50 (or $3.80, or €3.50), and it’s available now.

Like Matt, I do most of my writing in Markdown, including _all_ of my writing here on Analog Senses, plus my regular collaborations in other sites like [Tools & Toys](http://toolsandtoys.net).

I really enjoy the simplicity of the Markdown format, but I especially appreciate its power. Being able to write in a readable format that can be converted to HTML in a straightforward, no-nonsense way is a huge benefit in my work. If your work — or play — involves writing for the Web at all, you could probably benefit a great deal from using Markdown.
