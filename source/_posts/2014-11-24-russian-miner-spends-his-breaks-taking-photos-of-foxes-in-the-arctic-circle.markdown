Bored Panda shows the amazing pictures of  Russian miner and photographer Ivan Kislov:

> Kislov, who lives in the north-eastern port city of Magadan, works in Chukotka as a mining engineer. When he has time during his long shifts, he looks to photography for “relaxation from routine.” He likes to go on “hikes to inaccessible places, raftings,” or just simple walking tours to “observe the wildlife.”

> Though he takes pictures of everything from bears and reindeer to wolves and stoats, Kislov says the foxes are often very willing models: “Foxes are curious and can come very close, and I shoot with wide angle and telephoto lenses.”

A word of caution, though: the aforelinked article contains several pictures of incredibly cute foxes that may induce a sudden desire to start using Firefox again. Limited exposure is advised.

If you like these images — and if you don't, you're probably dead inside — don't forget to check out [Mr. Kislov's website](http://ivankislov.ru/) and his [500px page](https://500px.com/ivankislov) for more Arctic fauna in all its enchanting glory.
