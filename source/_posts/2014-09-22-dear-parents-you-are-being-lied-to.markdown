Jennifer Raff thoroughly debunks the myth that vaccination is bad for our childen: 

> They say that if other people’s children are vaccinated, there’s no need for their children to get vaccinated.

> This is one of the most despicable arguments I’ve ever heard. First of all, vaccines aren’t always 100% effective, so it is possible for a vaccinated child to still become infected if exposed to a disease. Worse, there are some people who can’t receive vaccinations, because they are immune deficient, or because they are allergic to some component. Those people depend upon [herd immunity](http://www.vaccines.gov/basics/protection/) to protect them. People who choose not to vaccinate their children against infectious diseases are putting not only their own children at risk, but also other people’s children.

This is an extremely important issue, and if you're a parent, it's your responsibility to learn about it, become informed beyond Internet gossip, and make the only sensible, reasonable choice: vaccinate your kids.

It deeply saddens me to think there are people so stubborn and irresponsible that they would gamble with their own children's lives like that.
