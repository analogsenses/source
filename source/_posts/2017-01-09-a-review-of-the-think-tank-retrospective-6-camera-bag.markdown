My last review of 2016 was about one of the best camera bags I’ve ever used: the [Think Tank Retrospective 6](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B01D2CTJVI&uk=B01D2CTJVI&es=B01D2CTJVI). 

Now, long-time readers may know that I’ve owned the smaller [Retrospective 5](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B004XYZI0Q&uk=B004XYZI0Q&es=B004XYZI0Q) for a few years already. That means I knew what to expect from the new bag going in, and I’m happy to say it didn’t disappoint.

The Retrospective 6 has all of the strengths of the 5, but its larger size makes it a lot more versatile. I can easily carry a full kit with it, and the entire package is somehow still light enough on my shoulder that I don’t get tired, unlike my previous experience with the [leather Brixton](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B01093D4HI&uk=B00AEB3PPC) by ONA.

The Retrospective 6 has quickly become my go-to bag, both for everyday use and for travel. That’s no small feat, I assure you.
