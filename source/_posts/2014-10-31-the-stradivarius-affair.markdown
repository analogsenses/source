Buzz Bissinger, Vanity Fair:

> It isn’t every day that a street criminal—a high-school dropout with two felony convictions—is accused of stealing a centuries-old violin worth as much as $6 million. But nothing about the heist of the Lipinski Stradivarius, which galvanized the music world last winter, was normal, or even logical.

Not all heists are planned by charming, sophisticated criminal masterminds.
