This week on the podcast we talked about the importance of how a camera makes you feel. We also took a look at the numbers of several mirrorless camera manufacturers, as well as DPReviewâ€™s incredibly in-depth review of the 2-year-old Nikon D810. And finally, we spent almost an hour talking about Instagram, including its recent redesign. All in all, a pretty complete episode.
