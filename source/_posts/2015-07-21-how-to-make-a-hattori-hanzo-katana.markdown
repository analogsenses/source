Have you ever wondered how traditional Japanese katanas were made centuries ago? YouTube show _Man at Arms_ shows you every step of the incredibly complex process by forging a replica of a Hattori Hanzō katana from the movie _Kill Bill_.

If you’re still feeling curious after watching the 18-minute video, you can also check out how they made a replica of [Sephiroth’s Masamune sword](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ySQratOnwk) from _[Final Fantasy VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VII)_, or [Squall’s Gunblade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GgijhlKbSc) from _[Final Fantasy VIII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_Fantasy_VIII)_. So awesome.
