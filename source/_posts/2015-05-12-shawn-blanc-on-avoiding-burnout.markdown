Shawn Blanc:

> They tell you to ship early and ship often. As a writer, shipping means getting your words onto the page and then getting them out there into the world.

> My focus was so intent on the _frequency_ of my publishing that I rarely felt liberty to do anything that took me away from getting at least one or two links up every day. This was folly.

Food for thought.
