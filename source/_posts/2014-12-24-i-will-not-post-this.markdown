Dave Pell:

> So don’t tweet. It’s not worth the risk. Don’t make phone calls. You’re being recorded. Don’t send emails. Sooner or later, we’ll all be reading them. Don’t take naked selfies, because some freak will find a way into your phone and share your photos in the seediest corners of the Internet. And the rest of us will have to look. Again, it’s not you. It’s us. On one hand, sorry for taking away your privacy, security and dignity. On the other hand, nice tits.

Privacy on the Internet is at an all-time low, and getting lower by the day. Companies like Google and Facebook get most of the bad press, but privacy is not invaded by companies, it's invaded by people. It's always been people. As long as there's money to be made by airing someone else's dirty secrets, this will not change.

If we want better privacy on the Internet, first we must become better people.
