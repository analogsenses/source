Allen Pike has some advice for the makers of [AeroPress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AeroPress):

> Side by side on a shelf with a more familiar coffee machine or french press, our beloved plunger is going to lose out. It’s unattractively packaged, strange, and its price seems too good to be true. I suspect the testimonials are intended to make it seem less weird, but beside the clean lines of a Bodum’s box they do the opposite. Shoppers looking for a gift are so turned off by AeroPress’ package that there is a market for [aftermarket gift boxes](http://shop.squaremilecoffee.com/products/aeropress-gift-box). A sad state for a great product.

Sometimes it’s hard not to judge a book by its cover.
