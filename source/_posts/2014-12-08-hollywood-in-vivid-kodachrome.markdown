Chris Rovzar, Vanity Fair:

> Suddenly, in the late 1930s and the 1940s, the American viewing audience went from thinking of Hollywood in black and white to experiencing it in stunning, rich color. Kodachrome was the vessel that brought hyper-real, hyper-beautiful stars into movie houses, magazines, and homes. In a new book, [_Hollywood in Kodachrome_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062265547/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0062265547&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=LC2HFDNHZ5GAE4MJ), David Wills collects some of the most brilliant images from 1940s Hollywood, including stills of Fred Astaire, Lucille Ball, Marlene Dietrich, and Frank Sinatra.

It's not Sinatra's best picture, but I'll take it anyway.
