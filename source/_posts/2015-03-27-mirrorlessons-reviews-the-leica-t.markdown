Interesting review by Mathieu Gasquet of MirrorLessons. It may look like he's not overly enthusiastic about the camera, but that's perhaps because of the huge expectations the Leica name invariably sets.

The new Leica T appears to be a very competent camera system, priced _way_ over its current performance level. But then again, that's what Leica has always been so I guess, in a way, it makes sense.
