Voigtlander today announced three new native E-mount lenses: the 10mm f/5.6 Hyper Wide Heliar, 12mm f/5.6 Ultra Wide Heliar, and 15mm f/4.5 Super Wide Heliar. 

The 10mm lens is the first ever Full Frame lens in that focal length. As for the other two lenses, this is what Mathieu Gasquet wrote over at _MirrorLessons_:

> The 12mm and 15mm lenses are based on the current VM versions. What’s new is that these E-Mount lenses will have electronic contacts so that the camera will be able to record exif data, including the focal length. Also, when using the focus ring, you can automatically activate the focus magnifier assist as you can do with the [Zeiss Loxia](http://www.mirrorlessons.com/2014/12/12/the-birth-of-a-new-family-zeiss-loxia-35mm-and-50mm-full-review/) lenses. Since the lenses will also communicate information such as the focusing distance, the A7 mark II series should be able to use 5 axis sensor stabilisation instead of only 3 axis.

All three lenses look great, although personally, I’m not really interested in any of them. They’re just too wide for my current needs.

A more important thing to note, however, is what this represents: yet another historical advantage of DSLRs — a wealth of high quality and affordable 3rd-party lenses — going out the window. 

It was only a matter of time before traditional 3rd-party lens makers like Voigtlander, Sigma and Tamron started doing native E-mount versions of their lenses. Voigtlander has been the first to market, but I’m willing to bet both Sigma and Tamron will follow suit sooner than you think.

With every passing month and year, the list of reasons to buy a DSLR over a mirrorless camera keeps getting shorter.
