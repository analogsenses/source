Great article by Michael Cavna for The Washington Post. “[Exploring Calvin and Hobbes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1449460364/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1449460364&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=H4TOLP6V2JV2OF52)” is a new book by Bill Watterson and Robb Jenny which is meant as a companion to the extensive Calvin and Hobbes exhibition at the Billy Ireland Cartoon Library at Ohio State University. The book is a wonderful trip down memory lane but perhaps best of all, it includes the first truly comprehensive interview with Bill Watterson in over 20 years:

> For years, the cartoonist didn’t make public comments. Now, in a single wide-ranging and revealing and illuminating and engrossing and self-deprecating and poignant and, of course, deeply funny interview, Watterson has proved more generous than we perhaps could have ever hoped for.

> Bill Watterson has delivered a gift, a trip down memory lane that is populated densely on each side with personal and professional insights — some grippingly specific, some that ring universal, many that resonate as both.

If this isn’t an instant buy, I don’t know what is.
