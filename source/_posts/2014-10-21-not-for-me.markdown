Patrick Rhone, on why the latest generation of Apple products (both hardware and software) is not for him:

> I’ve been around too long and learned from experience that technology has to prove itself. It should [make us better](http://patrickrhone.com/2013/04/10/is-this-making-me-better/). It should [solve problems](http://minimalmac.com/post/73277791743/what-problem-does-this-solve). And, we should consider these things before allowing any new tool into our daily lives. We should ask ourselves if it’s for us.

My 2008 iMac, my 2010 MacBook Pro and my 1972 vinyl record player agree with this.
