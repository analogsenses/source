[A man and his music. A Frank Sinatra playlist | Spotify](http://open.spotify.com/user/yasiesoya/playlist/4lQrC4uc2hibPRjrCSQnmt)

On a day much like today in 1915, Frank Sinatra was born. Here's a small playlist for today with my favorite songs. Play it to yourself, relax and enjoy his gentle, soothing voice. Play it at work, play it on your way home, or play it to your significant other. Better yet, to your future significant other. This is romance the way it should be. Simply put, nobody makes music like this anymore.

Frank Sinatra was a man of his time. He enjoyed each and every day as if it were his last. He was just as proud of his failures (and there were quite a few) as he was of his successes, and he really went through life with a cavalier attitude until the end, maybe like no one else has.

Here's to your very good health, sir. You are still, as always, very sorely missed.
