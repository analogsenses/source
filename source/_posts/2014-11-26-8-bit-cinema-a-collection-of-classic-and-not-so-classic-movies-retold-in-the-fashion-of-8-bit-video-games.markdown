_“8-bit Cinema”_ is a YouTube playlist by [CineFix](http://cinefix.com). It's a collection of classic — and not so classic — movies retold in the fashion of 8-bit video games, which works surprisingly well. 

Some really great movies are represented here, including The Matrix, Silence of the Lambs, The Dark Knight and many more. Unfortunately, [their latest video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Oo3IqyPAc&index=1&list=PL1AXWu-gGX6LNsfQ-KkeGPxL76CFONTom) is based on [Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1291150/) — the 2014 version.

After the excruciating experience of [Transformers](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0418279/), I vowed to never again watch another Michael Bay movie, so this probably is as close as I'll ever get to watching TNMT. Bay is involved as a producer and he's already ruined enough childhood memories for me, thank you very much.

I'm not even going to embed the video here out of decorum but, as a personal favor to you, dear reader, I'll leave you with [the 8-bit remake of The Avengers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P-5c5ct1FfM&index=9&list=PL1AXWu-gGX6LNsfQ-KkeGPxL76CFONTom) instead:
