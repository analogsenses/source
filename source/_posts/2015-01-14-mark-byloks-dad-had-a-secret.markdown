What a beautiful piece by Mark Bylok, author of [The Whisky Cabinet](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1770502378/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1770502378&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=YF3GDQJ7M7CBCB5O):

> Learning of my dad’s secret helped me prioritize my writing. He died with an unpublished poetry collection. I had an opportunity to change my own future. Unlike before, I was able to focus on getting published. I've replaced some movie watching and lazy weekends with writing. The first year after his death my writing seemed to be going nowhere, but with practice, things started to change.

I'm so happy for Mark. I can't wait to get my hands on my copy of The Whisky Cabinet.
