Apple’s yearly September event is already upon us, and this year the company is _[strongly](http://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/8/29/12694646/iphone-7-event-invite-over-analysis)_ hinting at significant camera improvements as one of the main features in the soon-to-be-announced new iPhones. As equal parts Apple enthusiasts and photography nerds, the [Candid.fm](http://www.candid.fm) team, including yours truly, will be covering the event live using a really cool app called [Talkshow](https://talkshow.im/show/xlRKQFItQZu6mzIM).

If you want to join in on the fun — and seriously, why wouldn’t you? — here’s a bunch of ways you can do that:

* If you want to participate by sending us questions, comments, or telling us all about your favorite beer, you can download [the Talkshow app](https://geo.itunes.apple.com/app/talkshow-texting-in-public/id1034537473?mt=8) and search for Candid.fm.

* If you just want to read along, you can go to [the show’s page](https://talkshow.im/show/xlRKQFItQZu6mzIM), or just watch below.

Whatever method you choose, don’t forget to bring your beverage of choice; it’s going to be epic. See you later!
