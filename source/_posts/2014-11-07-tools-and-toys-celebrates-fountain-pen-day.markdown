Chris Gonzales:

> Today is [Fountain Pen Day](http://www.fountainpenday.org/) — there really is a holiday for everything these days — and to celebrate the occasion we thought it would be fun to share some [quality linkage](http://toolsandtoys.net/?s=quality+linkage) related to fountain pens and analog writing in general.

Wonderful reading material for a rainy weekend.
