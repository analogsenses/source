My review of the [Beoplay H5 wireless earphones](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B01G491MSY&uk=B01G491MSY&es=B01G491MSY) by B&O PLAY was published today at _Tools & Toys_. These were very tricky to review, because as much as I love their _awesome_ sound quality and their stunning design, they do have a fair number of quirks.

If youâ€™re in the market for wireless earphones, you really should give the Beoplay H5 a good look. Head on over to _Tools & Toys_ for [the full review](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/a-review-of-the-beoplay-h5-wireless-earphones/).
