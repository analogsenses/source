What an amazing story. The Rescued Film Project is an online archive gallery of images captured between the 1930's and the 1990's, curated and restored by photographer Levi Bettwieser. He rescues images found on film from all over the world and he recently made an incredible discovery: a batch of 31 rolls of undeveloped film, all from the same photographer — a WWII soldier — and all over 70 years old.

The images are impressive, but the developing process itself is also fascinating. I definitely have to try that sometime. Via [Messy Nessy](http://www.messynessychic.com/2015/01/20/what-happens-when-you-discover-31-rolls-of-undeveloped-film-from-a-wwii-soldier/).
