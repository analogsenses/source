Speaking of the future, this exchange between BuzzFeed’s Alex Kantrowitz and M, the new Virtual Assistant in Facebook Messenger, is so good it’s actually spooky. Its context awareness is extremely impressive, and its natural language parsing appears to be flawless.

The fact that you can explicitly tell M _not_ to save your personal information is another nice touch, especially considering this is Facebook we’re talking about. Of course, it would have been even better had it been the other way around — if M didn’t save your data unless you explicitly told it to.

That said, I don’t think we should expect things to be this smooth during uncontrolled exchanges in real life, but if Kantrowitz’s experience is anything to go by, I’d say M is off to an excellent start.
