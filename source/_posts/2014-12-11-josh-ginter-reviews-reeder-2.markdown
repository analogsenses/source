Another excellent software review by Josh Ginter. This time, he takes a look at my favorite RSS app: Reeder 2. I use it all the time on my Macs, my iPad and my iPhone, and I vastly prefer it over the native Feedly clients.

If you're curious about it, Josh's review has everything you want to know, and a few other things you haven't thought of yet. Great stuff, as ever.
