Great news from Marco:

> After a year of work, Overcast 2 is now available as a free update for everyone. It’s mostly a major under-the-hood improvement, with relatively few user-facing changes. But they’re pretty good, I think.

> And now, **all features are free**, and I’m trying a new business model.

Overcast 2 adds some really awesome features like streaming, which will allow you to start playing an episode immediately, instead of having to wait for it to fully download to your device. I’ve been looking forward to this feature ever since Overcast was first released, and I can’t wait to try it out.

As for the new business model, Marco is now offering a $1 monthly patronage option within the app:

> If only 5% of customers become monthly patrons, Overcast will match its previous revenue.

> Patrons may get special features in the future if I can’t afford to offer something to everyone (due to hosting costs, etc.), but today, patronage is simply that: supporting Overcast directly, because you want to. And if you’d rather not, no hard feelings.

Simple, easy, and respectful towards his customers. In other words, quintessentially Marco. I’m sold.
