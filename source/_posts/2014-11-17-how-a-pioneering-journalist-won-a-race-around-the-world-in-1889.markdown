Brian Phillips tells the fascinating story of Nellie Bly, a female journalist who 125 years ago set out to win a bet she made with her newspaper:

> “It is impossible for you to do it,” he told her. “You are a woman and would need a protector.” Even if she could travel alone, he said, she’d want to take too much baggage. “There is no use talking about it,” he insisted. “No one but a man could do this.”

> “Very well,” she said. “Start the man, and I’ll start the same day for some other newspaper and beat him.”

> She was 24 when she said this. The next year, a few months after her 25th birthday, the paper said yes, and she set sail.

> She brought one suitcase.

So great.
