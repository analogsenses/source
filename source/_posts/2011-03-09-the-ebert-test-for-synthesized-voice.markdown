[The Roger Ebert Test for Synthesized Voice | The New York Times](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/07/roger-ebert-tests-his-vocal-cords-and-comedic-delivery/?ref=technology)


<blockquote>Last Friday Roger Ebert, the movie critic who lost his ability to speak several years ago after his lower jaw was removed, used a [computer-created voice](http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20100226/PEOPLE/100229986) to tell a joke to an audience of over 1,000 people at the TED conference in Long Beach, Calif.</blockquote>


A great example of technology at the service of human beings. Probably the very reason why I started this site.


<blockquote>"If the computer can successfully tell a joke, and do the timing and delivery, as well as Henny Youngman, then that’s the voice I want,” Mr. Ebert said.</blockquote>


Truly inspiring.
