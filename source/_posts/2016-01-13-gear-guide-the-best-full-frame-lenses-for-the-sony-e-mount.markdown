description: "Camera bodies come and go, but lenses are long-term investments. Choose wisely."
---

Back in late 2013, Sony surprised the photography world with the release of the Sony Alpha α7, a remarkable mirrorless camera with interchangeable lenses and a top-of-the-line, 24-MP Full Frame sensor.

One year later, the second-generation of α7 bodies was released, including features like in-body image stabilization (IBIS), better electronic viewfinders, and more robust bodies that are now standard across all models.

As great as Sony’s camera bodies are, however, the true value of a camera system is measured by its lenses and by that measure, the Full Frame E-mount system is still very much in its infancy. However, in little over two years, Sony has done a remarkable job of covering the most important bases.

<p class="full-width"><img src="https://farm1.staticflickr.com/572/21909743885_c2a9edc8bc_o.jpg"/></p>

In practical terms, the Full Frame E-mount system could be considered a joint-venture between Sony and Zeiss. The two companies have a long-standing working relationship, and nowhere is it more evident than here. Indeed, Sony and Zeiss combined have released a staggering 16 Full Frame lenses for the E-mount system to date, with at least eight more to come in early 2016. No matter how you look at it, that’s an impressive pace.

As a result of all this innovation, photographers are flocking over to the FE system in droves, and with good reason. With the release of so many excellent cameras and lenses in such a short period of time, this is arguably the hottest platform in photography right now.

But with so many new and shiny things to choose from, it can sometimes be hard to make the right choice for your needs. In this guide, we’ll go over some of the best pieces of glass for the system, focusing on the ones that can be considered great long-term investments.

##Criteria for inclusion

First and foremost, this guide focuses on lenses that are great long-term investments. While there are certainly other lenses compatible with the system that may be more affordable, every single one of the lenses included here can be thought of as best-in-class, and is therefore guaranteed to hold its value and perform flawlessly for many years to come.

Secondly, the guide focuses on Full Frame lenses only. Sony also makes APS-C-sized E-mount lenses and cameras, but those are outside the scope of this article. To avoid confusion, Full Frame E-mount lenses are commonly referred to as FE lenses, and the Full Frame E-mount system as the FE system.

Thirdly, the guide only considers native E-mount lenses. The E-mount system is famous because, thanks to its short flange distance, its cameras can use almost every DSLR lens in existence with adapters, including Sony’s own A-mount line of lenses. Using adapted lenses, however, presents its own set of issues, not the least of which is unreliability. There’s also great variation in lens behavior depending on the particular lens + adapter combination. For these reasons, adapted lenses are also outside the scope of this article.

<p class="full-width"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1538/23729140464_f3b4b1ee63_o.jpg" width="832"/></p>

<p class="photo-credit">Besides native FE lenses, E-mount cameras are compatible with a wide array of DSLR lenses via the use of adapters, but those are outside the scope of this guide.</p>

Finally, the guide is structured in several categories, arranged by focal length and/or primary application. It’s worth pointing out that the guide considers zoom lenses as their own separate category, so unless specifically noted, all other categories in the guide refer to prime lenses only. The same thing applies to manual-focus lenses.

These categories are, in order:

* Wide angle lenses
* Standard lenses
* Portrait lenses
* Macro lenses
* Zoom lenses
* Video lenses
* Manual focus lenses

These categories were created based on the current available lens lineup for the system. In the future, additional categories such as fisheye lenses, ultra-wide angle lenses, and super telephoto lenses may be added, as lenses meeting the corresponding criteria are released. Given the youth of the FE system as a whole and the pace at which new lenses are being announced, the addition of at least some of these categories in the near future appears very likely.

Now, without further ado, let’s take a look at the best Full Frame lenses for the E-mount system.


<p class="card-separator">♤</p>

##Wide angle lenses

For the purpose of this guide, wide angle lenses are those with a focal length wider than 35mm. Technically, lenses wider than 24mm would be considered ultra-wide angle lenses, but as of January 2016 there are no true ultra-wide angle lenses for the FE system, other than the 16-35mm f/4 lens, which is included in the zoom lens category.

Wide angle lenses are perfect for landscape, travel and architecture photography, but they can also be used to great effect indoors, especially in confined spaces. These lenses allow you to play with perspective in a way that is completely different from how our eyes see the world, which is why they encourage creativity and serve as great tools to learn composition and framing.

###Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2

The Batis family of lenses was announced by Zeiss last year. They are designed and built by Zeiss, but unlike the lenses Zeiss makes for Canon, Nikon and other manufacturers, the Batis are fully native E-mount lenses with autofocus, weather sealing, a cool and useful new OLED screen that displays the depth of field scale, and a solid metal design. They also pack some serious image quality, as we’ve come to expect from the German manufacturer.

The **Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2** is the wider of the two lenses in the Batis family, and also the most expensive. At $1,299, it is clearly intended to be a top-notch optical tool for landscape photographers, and the first few reviews all appear to agree on that. This lens uses a tried-and-true Distagon design, as well as Zeiss’ own T\* multi-coating to reduce flare, making it an excellent performer for a wide range of applications.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1593/23728519784_3691b44913_b.jpg" width="500"/>

Unfortunately, Zeiss is still having trouble manufacturing the Batis lenses in sufficient quantities due to the overwhelming demand, so buying one online can be difficult — unless you’re willing to overpay for it by a good few hundred dollars. Likewise, finding one in your local dealer might be a matter of luck, but if you do manage to snatch one, you’re in for a treat.

<p class="card-separator">♧</p>

##Standard lenses

The barrier between the wide angle and standard focal lengths is somewhat open to interpretation. For some people, wide angle lenses go up to 35mm inclusive, with 50mm being the first true standard focal length. Others, however, think 35mm is already long enough to be considered standard. Although this is purely a personal preference, this guide considers 35mm lenses to be part of the standard range.

Standard lenses are the most intuitive to use for most people. These lenses render the world around us in a very familiar way, which makes composing your images a very straightforward affair. Just point, click and in most cases, what you see with your own eyes is what you’re going to get in the picture.

Standard lenses are the perfect entry-point into the photography world for the vast majority of people, but their applications don’t stop there — far from it, actually. A great standard lens is a valuable asset to have in any kit, so let’s take a look at what we have here.
 

###Sony Zeiss FE 35mm f/1.4 Distagon T\*

35mm is perhaps the most versatile focal length. From street photography, photo-journalism, environmental portraits and even the occasional landscape shot, most everyday scenes look “just right” through a 35mm lens. And at f/1.4, there’s plenty of control over depth of field — can you say _bokeh_? — as well as enough speed for low light photography. It will come as no surprise, then, that 35mm f/1.4 lenses are a staple of every Full Frame camera system out there.

The **Sony Zeiss FE 35mm f/1.4 Distagon T\*** is the first such lens for the Full Frame E-mount system, and what a lens it is. Designed as a collaboration between the two companies, it is manufactured by Sony up to Zeiss specifications, and it’s currently the fastest 1st-party lens for the E-mount system.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1704/23729877683_a8695bc94d_b.jpg" width="500"/>

On the technical front, the lens features a Distagon design with 12 elements in 8 groups and 9 rounded aperture blades. These two design treats give it a superior bokeh when compared to similar lenses for other systems. Sharpness is excellent across the frame right from f/1.4, and the lens becomes razor-sharp when stopped down a bit, even in the extreme corners. It also uses Zeiss’ T\* coating, and has weather sealing.

Besides its speed, the 35mm Distagon is also unique in that it features a switch that changes the clicky-ness of the aperture ring: with just a simple flick you can choose between having nice and reassuring clicks every 1/3rd of a stop, and having a completely click-less aperture ring that is smooth and silent, and therefore better suited for video recording.

Finally, the 35mm Distagon is a rather big and heavy lens, especially for a mirrorless system. And at $1,598, it’s also the most expensive FE lens to date, and one of the most expensive 35mm lenses for any camera system. However, its optical performance and excellent build quality more than make up for its high price and considerable heft. If you value lenses as long-term investments, you’ll be absolutely delighted by this one.

###Sony Zeiss FE 55mm f/1.8 Sonnar T\*

If 35mm is the most versatile focal length, then 50mm is by far the most popular. 50mm f/1.8 lenses, commonly known as “nifty-fifties” have been bundled as kit lenses by nearly all manufacturers for decades, and with good reason: they’re very good optically, and they’re _very_ cheap to make. What’s not to love?

Sony, however, took a different approach when planning the first few lenses for their FE system. What if a 50mm lens didn’t have to be cheap? What if you took price out of the equation and simply focused on making the best 50mm lens that you could? What would such a lens look like?

The answer is, it would probably look a lot like the **Sony Zeiss FE 55mm f/1.8 Sonnar T\*** lens. Here we have a standard lens with a maximum aperture of “only” f/1.8, and a price tag of just a hair under $1,000. Something doesn’t add up here, because these prices are reserved for more exotic, faster lenses with f/1.4 or even f/1.2 maximum apertures.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1484/24248468412_2fb9da972e_b.jpg" width="500"/>

Luckily, specs aren’t everything. With an all-metal, weather-sealed body, the Sonnar 55mm lens packs professional-grade image quality in a relatively light and compact package. This is the sharpest FE lens by far, being incredibly sharp right from f/1.8. That means it’s fully usable in any situations, and you’ll never need to stop it down just to get acceptable image quality, as you often would with cheaper lenses.

The Sonnar 55mm lens also happens to have one of the most beautiful bokehs of any standard lens out there. Now, bokeh is a notoriously subjective thing, but the Sonnar 55mm renders very smooth and creamy images with incredibly abrupt transitions between the in-focus and the out-of-focus areas. This helps it achieve the classic Zeiss “pop” and 3D effect that so many photographers crave.

At the end of the day, if all you want is a cheap nifty-fifty, then this lens clearly isn’t for you. But if you want a _great_ standard lens, one that you’ll want to keep and use for decades, look no further than the Sonnar 55mm f/1.8 lens.

##Portrait lenses

If a good standard lens is essential for every camera system, an outstanding portrait lens is often described as a system seller, the lens that makes photographers choose one system over another. 

Portrait lenses are longer than standard lenses, and typically have focal lengths in the 80-150mm range. If we go longer than that, we’re really talking about telephoto lenses, which are commonly used for sports, wildlife photography, astrophotography, and the like. These are all situations where there’s a limit to how physically close to your subject you can get and therefore, greater magnification from the lens is needed.

Portrait lenses are often described as short telephoto lenses as well, which can understandably lead to confusion sometimes. Although that’s technically true, each type has clearly different applications, and this guide will consider them as separate categories. As of this guide’s publication date (January 2016), there are no prime lenses longer than 150mm for the FE system, so the distinction between the two groups is a rather moot point anyway. This is likely to become relevant in the future, though.

###Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8

The other lens in the Batis family is the first true portrait lens for the FE system, and it just so happens to be one of the best portrait lenses for _any_ system. You see where this is going, don’t you?

The **Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8** lens finds itself in pretty much the same situation as both the 35mm Distagon and the 55mm Sonnar lenses mentioned above: at $1,199, it is certainly more expensive than similar lenses for other systems, but its build quality and optical performance are also clearly superior, making it well worth it in the end. This is quickly becoming a recurring theme in the FE system as a whole.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1657/23729877603_92083475c9_b.jpg" width="500"/>

In addition to the weather sealing, all-metal body and OLED display that the lens shares with its 25mm sister, the 85mm Batis also features built-in image stabilization technology. This will work on its own to provide 2-3 stops worth of real-world stabilization, or together with the in-body image stabilization technology (IBIS) found in the 2nd-generation α7-series cameras to achieve up to 4 stops of stabilization. Not bad, indeed.

At this price point some people will no doubt still be unfazed by the lens’s modest maximum aperture of f/1.8, but if you’ve ever shot with an 85mm Full Frame lens, then you know that depth of field at most working distances is already super-thin at this aperture. If you were to use an even faster lens you’d quickly run into frequent focusing issues, such as only having one eye in focus, or placing focus on the nose and missing the eyes.

Despite what speed evangelists say, if you want great portraits, f/1.8 is more than enough, and the 85mm Batis excels at doing just that. Faster lenses definitely have their place, and can be used to great effect in some situations, but they are by no means a requirement for doing awesome portraiture work.

In exchange for that extra bit of light-gathering ability, the 85mm Batis gives you a whole lot more in terms of image quality: sharp across the frame wide open, this lens is fully usable right from f/1.8, and definitely sharper than any other 85mm lenses at that aperture, except Zeiss’ own [85mm Otus](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NGEE102/?tag=analogsens-20&linkId=HGVDXZKEXUYX5IKO) lens. That said, keep in mind that, while the Otus is sharper and faster, it also costs a whopping $4,000 and lacks both autofocus and image stabilization, which the Batis has. When you look at it that way, the Batis sure looks like an excellent bargain by comparison.

All in all, the 85mm Batis is a truly outstanding portrait lens surely deserving of a place in your kit. Unfortunately, this lens is currently suffering from the same production delays as the 25mm Batis, and finding one is still very much a matter of luck. If you come across one, either online or in a store, don’t give it a second thought. It’s a truly remarkable piece of glass.

##Macro lenses

Macro lenses serve a very specific purpose, which is why they have their own category. Designed to take pictures of small subjects at very close focusing distances, macro lenses depict subjects at greater than life size. 

The difference between close-up photography and macro photography is therefore defined by the **reproduction ratio**, which measures the amount of magnification achieved by the lens on the sensor. In layman’s terms, as explained by [John Wattie](http://nzphoto.tripod.com/3d/520_3dmacro.html): **“If a 24mm vertical object is too tall to fit in the camera viewfinder, you are taking a macro photograph.”** Since Full Frame sensors have a size of 24x36mm, this would mean that the object is being rendered on the sensor at greater than life size. This is a great example to intuitively understand the difference.

With that in mind, **true macro** lenses are those capable of achieving a reproduction ratio of 1:1, meaning that the size of the subject on the sensor is _exactly_ the same as in real life. A 1 cm long ant, for example, would take up exactly 1 cm on the sensor when shot with a 1:1 macro lens. This rate of magnification allows for capturing exceptional levels of detail, and for making subjects appear much greater in pictures than they are in real life.

###Sony FE 90mm f/2.8 Macro G OSS

As most of this guide has made clear, the FE system is more about quality than it is about quantity. It will come as no surprise, then, that the **Sony FE 90mm f/2.8 Macro G OSS** is currently the only 1st-party macro lens for the system. And hopefully, the fact that it’s an optically superb lens shouldn’t come as a surprise, either.

With a maximum magnification rate of 1:1, the Sony 90mm is a true macro lens. As befitting a G-series lens — Sony’s branding for their premium line of lenses — it also has an all-metal body, weather sealing, and for the first time in a Full Frame macro lens, optical image stabilization (called Optical SteadyShot by Sony, or simply OSS) built right into the lens. So whether you own one of the 1st-generation α7-series cameras, or the current 2nd-generation models with IBIS, you’ll be able to get sharp, crisp shots handheld, which is a huge win for macro shooters.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1696/24061123240_921cc0f323_b.jpg" width="500"/>

On the image quality front, the Sony 90mm macro lens is super sharp right from f/2.8, and color and contrast are also excellent. And since you’ll be focusing at extremely close distances most of the time, you’ll be able to get plenty of bokeh in your shots as well.

Aside from being a great macro lens, the Sony 90mm macro lens does an excellent job of doubling as a portrait lens. While f/2.8 certainly won’t blow your mind, it’s still more than enough to achieve a decent amount of subject separation when shooting conventional portraits, and the impeccable optical quality of the lens ensures excellent results when used this way.

If portraiture is your bread and butter as a photographer, you’ll probably be better off getting the 85mm Batis instead, but if you want an extremely capable macro lens that can more than hold its own when used as a portrait lens, you can’t go wrong with this one. 

In fact, I know some people who actually bought this lens because they were tired of waiting for the Batis to ship in volume, and once they used it they never looked back. It really is that good. And at $1,098, it’s even a bit cheaper than the Batis.

<p class="card-separator">♤</p>

##Zoom lenses

Traditionally, prime lenses have always offered three distinct advantages over zoom lenses: size and weight, image quality, and speed. Those are very compelling features in a lens, which is why many photographers choose to go prime-only when building their kit. You can indeed cover a reasonably wide focal range with just a few primes, and your entire kit would stay nimble enough to carry anywhere, all while enjoying the benefits of fast glass and excellent image quality.

If that sounds like a great proposition to you, that’s because it is. Unfortunately, there are many situations when shooting with only prime lenses is just not very practical. Event photography, for example, requires the utmost flexibility to recompose and frame your shot from scene to scene, all of which needs to be done in a fraction of a second. In that kind of situation, zoom lenses provide much more flexibility, and will make your life a lot easier.

Zoom lenses are also not what they used to be, and for the most part, that’s a good thing. Image quality has improved dramatically in recent years, to the point where modern zooms actually rival prime lenses in terms of sharpness and overall image quality. If you decide to go with a zoom lens as part of your kit, the only thing you’ll be potentially missing from an equivalent set of primes is speed. However, it’s worth keeping in mind that this improved optical performance usually comes at a cost in terms of both price and size/weight: good, fast zooms are expensive, and they’re _big_.

For a Full Frame DSLR, having a big and expensive zoom lens isn’t really a problem, as most professional photographers are used to dealing with hefty lenses. For a mirrorless system, though, that same tradeoff is not as attractive due to the different ergonomics of the camera body. This might explain, to a certain extent, why Sony is yet to release a line of f/2.8 zooms for the FE system. Luckily, they do offer a complete lineup of f/4 zooms, most of which are perfectly capable of delivering excellent image quality, and remain compact enough to be easily handled. Let’s take a look at some of them.


###Sony Zeiss Vario-Tessar T* FE 16–35mm f/4 ZA OSS

This zoom lens gives α7-series shooters a window into the ultra-wide angle focal range, and it’s currently the only 1st-party FE lens to do so. If autofocus and the ability to capture shots wider than 24mm is a requirement for you, this is your only choice.

Luckily, the **Sony Zeiss Vario-Tessar T\* FE 16–35mm F4 ZA OSS** is a really good lens. Being another collaboration between Sony and Zeiss, the lens shares many of the features found in some of the other lenses on this list. That includes an all-metal design, weather sealing, built-in image stabilization (OSS), and the use of Zeiss’ T\* multi-coating.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1693/24061123220_21745045f8_b.jpg" width="500"/>

What’s new about this lens is, of course, the ability to zoom and change focal length while maintaining impressive resolution and image quality across the entire zoom range. This makes the lens considerably bigger and heavier than most primes, though, except for the 35mm Distagon and the 90mm macro, both of which are roughly comparable to this one in size and weight.

Sharpness-wise, the lens renders crisp and detailed images in the center right from f/4 and at all focal lengths. The corners are still perfectly good at f/4, but they don’t reach the same resolution as the center, something that is to be expected in a lens of this nature. The corners sharpen up nicely by f/8, where the lens is super-sharp across the entire frame.

Vignetting is surprisingly low at the wide end, which is difficult to achieve in a wide angle lens. Distortion, however, is a bit more pronounced, but is very well corrected by software, either in-camera if you shoot JPEG, or in Adobe Lightroom with the included lens profile. Neither is a problem in real-world usage.

Finally, being a wide angle lens, there isn’t a whole lot of bokeh to speak of, even at f/4, but the little there is does look acceptable, if not spectacular. On the other hand, thanks to its seven aperture blades this lens renders beautiful sunstars when stopped down.

All in all, a very good ultra-wide angle lens for your α7-series camera. If you shoot landscapes, this one is definitely worth adding to your kit. It currently retails for $1,348.

###Sony FE 70-200mm f/4 G OSS

Just like the 16-35mm lens at the wide end, this one is also the only telephoto zoom currently available for the FE system, so in terms of choice, there isn’t much of it going on here, either. In terms of quality, though, this lens offers it in spades.

The **Sony FE 70-200mm f/4 G OSS** is a moderate telephoto zoom. This is a very versatile focal range, which is why 70-200mm lenses are extremely popular among many different kinds of photographers: sports shooters, event photographers, portrait photographers... you name it. As a result, every Full Frame camera system out there offers one or more lenses in this focal range.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1505/23728519604_03636d9755_b.jpg" width="500"/>

While an f/2.8 version of this lens would have been appreciated by many, it’s entirely understandable why Sony chose not to offer it initially. The reality is that, for most uses, f/4 gets you most of the way there and it does so while keeping the lens reasonably small and light. That’s a perfectly valid tradeoff to make, and I’m sure many people will actually prefer the f/4 version even after a future f/2.8 model is announced — which will undoubtedly happen at some point. A massive f/2.8 zoom doesn’t really do you any good if it’s sitting on the shelf at home instead of in your bag.

This 70-200mm lens is a G-series lens, meaning it was designed and manufactured entirely by Sony. The G-series is their premium line of lenses, and is supposed to offer exceptional image and build quality. Judging by the performance of this lens, the G label seems more than appropriate.

The Sony 70-200mm f/4 is built like a small tank: not very heavy considering what it is, but impressively solid. It has an all-metal body with weather sealing, and comes bundled with a metal tripod collar, which is a nice touch. The focus and zoom rings are made of textured rubber and they’re both very smooth and pleasant to use. Furthermore, there are three focus hold buttons on the barrel, something that clearly shows this is a high-end piece of glass.

The lens also has optical image stabilization (OSS) built in, and can provide up to four stops of real-world stabilization when used on a 2nd-generation α7-series body. Other niceties include dedicated switches for focus mode, focus range, OSS, and panning mode. These make using the lens everyday much easier and more convenient.

Image quality-wise, there’s hardly anything to complain about here: sharpness is outstanding across the frame at all focal lengths, bokeh is excellent, distortion is minimal and vignetting is essentially invisible in real world usage. Flare resistance is also very good, and focusing speed and accuracy are top notch. If you don’t like this lens, I can assure you it’s not the lens’s fault.

At $1,498, this isn’t a cheap lens by any means, but it’s worth every penny. Since this is currently your only choice in the telephoto range, recommending it is easy, but even if there were other options to choose from, the Sony 70-200mm f/4 gets so many things right that improving upon it seems like an exceedingly tall order.

<p class="card-separator">♧</p>

##Manual focus lenses

Today, most people rely on autofocus for the vast majority of their shooting, so it’s understandable that AF lenses represent the majority of this list. Still, some people just prefer shooting with true manual-focus glass, which is entirely different and carries some very important benefits of its own.

One such benefit is size. Since manual lenses don’t need to include AF motors, they are considerably more compact than comparable lenses with AF. This means you could potentially build a kit of all-manual lenses with exceptional image quality that would take up only a fraction of space in your bag. For some photographers, this is a huge win. It also comes in very handy when going on a trip and trying to pack light, for example, as it allows you to keep things nice and compact while still taking all of your lenses with you.

Another benefit is reliability. No electric moving parts means fewer elements that can go wrong and require servicing down the road. It also means more peace of mind on important shoots. Manual lenses are essentially lifetime purchases, unless you do something terribly wrong to them. As long as you don’t let dust get inside the lens elements, they should work flawlessly for decades.

A third benefit is build quality. Manual lenses, especially the ones Zeiss makes, are incredibly well built. They have all-metal bodies and focusing mechanisms, and an overall quality that puts most other lenses to shame. And since they’re built to last, they don’t need to be handled with gloves.

Finally, the main reason to shoot with a manual lens is that it’s just a more reflexive, more enjoyable experience. The act of focusing manually slows down the entire photographic process and forces you to be more proactive in the way you compose your images. This can help you discover new ways to shoot, and make you enjoy grabbing your camera every day. 

Even though manual lenses are becoming more and more rare, Zeiss continues to be one of the most important manufacturers, and luckily, their offerings for the E-mount system show what they can still do when they mean business.

###The Zeiss Loxia lenses

As perhaps the best manufacturer of manual lenses — it’s basically a tossup between Zeiss and Leica — the news that Zeiss would release a family of true manual focus lenses for the FE system was received with enthusiasm by many. That family is called **Loxia**, and currently features three different models, with more sure to come in the near future.

All of the Loxia lenses share the same hallmark features: an all-metal design, a dedicated aperture ring, a nice and compact size, and an included metal hood. They also feature a click-less option for the aperture ring that can be enabled by turning a screw on the lens mount. This allows users to choose their preferred behavior for these lenses, and makes them well suited for video recording, too.

Besides that, the Loxia lenses are fully native E-mount lenses with electronic integration at all levels. That means EXIF data is relayed to the camera, and aperture can be controlled from the camera body if you so desire by setting the aperture ring to “A”. Both aperture priority and shutter priority modes work flawlessly, and of course, so does manual mode.

What’s perhaps more interesting about this electronic integration is the fact that the Loxia lenses can automatically trigger in-camera manual focus aids like focus peaking and magnification by simply turning the focus ring. This is a huge advantage that makes manual focusing a lot easier, and it’s a unique feature that no other manual lens for the system offers.

Let’s take a look at all thee Loxia lenses so far:

<p class="full-width"><img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1539/23728519574_1506d209a3_o.jpg"/></p>

* The **Zeiss Loxia 21mm f/2.8** is the newest and widest of the three, and at $1,499, it's also the most expensive. As of this guide’s publication, the lens hasn’t officially shipped yet. It’s scheduled to ship in early February, and promises outstanding image quality in an ultra-wide prime for the first time in the FE system. We’ll have to wait and see how well it performs in the real world, but if it’s anything like its siblings, it’s surely going to be a stunner. So far, the few reviewers that got advanced copies all seemed to love the lens, so there’s definitely something to look forward to here.

* The **Zeiss Loxia 35mm f/2 Biogon T\*** is a wonderful lens, and in my mind, the one worth getting first out of the three Loxias. The reason for that is that it’s almost as good optically and almost as fast as the 35mm Distagon, but it’s a whole lot smaller. If you can live without AF, this lens will probably be better for you than the Distagon, if only because you won’t be as limited when it comes to using it as a walk-around lens, which is one of the primary purposes of a 35mm lens to begin with. That said, keep in mind that the Loxia uses a Biogon design, which will render images with a different character than the Distagon. In general, most people prefer the Distagon’s bokeh, but this is all entirely subjective. The point is, your mileage may vary, so be sure to try one if at all possible before buying, but rest assured, the 35mm Loxia is a _gorgeous_ lens. It currently retails for $1,299.

* The **Zeiss Loxia 50mm f/2 Planar T\*** is the most affordable of the three at $949, but it’s also the least interesting to me. Part of that has to do with just how ridiculously good the 55mm Sonnar with AF is, of course. Both lenses are similar on paper, but the 55mm has the edge in terms of sharpness, bokeh, and overall usefulness. The Loxia is definitely better built, but again, it’s not as if the Sonnar isn’t well built itself. Price-wise, there’s not much difference between them, either. In this case, unless you need or totally prefer MF, I have to recommend going with the 55mm Sonnar instead of this one. From a future-proof point of view, however, both lenses are excellent investments, which is why the 50mm Loxia makes this list despite not being my personal preference.

At the end of the day, all of the Loxia lenses are excellent, and present a very interesting alternative for those who prefer or require manual focus. A time-tested classic with a modern twist, indeed.

##Lenses optimized for video

The final category in this guide includes lenses optimized for video, also called cine lenses. Unlike lenses designed for taking pictures, cine lenses have a different set of requirements and features.

Although cine lenses can be used for taking pictures, they are usually not competitive with comparable photo lenses in terms of price or resolution. Cine lenses are clearly aimed at video professionals, which means they are usually quite expensive and feature super-tough metal bodies. In a typical production or studio environment, there’s no time to baby the equipment, so these lenses need to be able to withstand many hours of daily abuse.

They’re also precision instruments, a factor that definitely contributes to increase their price. While the vast majority of photo lenses use what is known as a varifocal design — meaning the focus point changes as you zoom in or out — Cine lenses are usually parfocal: you can zoom in and out of your subject without losing focus. This is absolutely essential for video, and can save you a ton of effort. Parfocal designs are much more complex and require more precision to implement, which ultimately drives up the cost of the lens.

In the FE system, there is currently only one 1st-party cine lens. Fortunately, it is a rather good one.

###Sony FE PZ 28-135mm f/4 G OSS

The **Sony FE PZ 28-135mm f/4 G OSS** lens covers a very versatile focal range with a constant maximum aperture of f/4. This comes in handy when zooming in while recording video, because it allows you to maintain the same exposure parameters across the zooming range.

The constant maximum aperture is great to have, but what makes this a video-first lens is the fact that it uses a parfocal design, which allows you to easily capture shots that would require the use of complex focus-pulling techniques with conventional photo lenses.

The lens is absolutely huge, but it’s actually relatively small and light if you compare with other Full Frame cine lenses. It features an all-metal body, weather sealing, and dedicated rings to control the zoom, the focus and the iris of the lens, another video-only feature. Even better, the focus ring actually has hard stops at infinity and the minimum focusing distance, which makes manual focus a breeze with this lens. It also has an internal zoom motor for electronic zoom control, which adds even more versatility to the lens.

At $2,498, this one’s definitely not cheap, but again, it’s actually pretty affordable if you compare it with other Full Frame cine lenses. If you’re a videographer, the Sony FE 28-135mm f/4 lens should definitely be a part of your kit.

##A brief aside on the Sony Zeiss 24-70mm f/4 lens

You might have noticed that there’s a high-profile omission in this guide: the **Sony Zeiss Vario-Tessar T\* FE 24-70mm f/4 ZA OSS** lens. That lens has been omitted because I do not consider it to be a good long-term investment, which is the primary criterium for inclusion in this guide. 

Despite being the only standard zoom available for the FE system at the time of this guide’s publication, the 24-70mm f/4 lens is clearly the weaker of all three FE zooms currently in the lineup. At 24mm  the lens is soft in the corners at all apertures, and it never really gets sharp. Besides, its overall image quality, while still pretty good, fails to match that of the other two lenses.

<img src="https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1519/24061123030_37f924c739_o.jpg" width="500"/>

There’s also the fact that Sony is rumored to release an f/2.8 version of this lens in the near future, possibly in a matter of weeks. This also makes me take a wait-and-see approach before recommending this lens. The rumored lens would be the first f/2.8 zoom for the FE system, and with expectations through the roof, Sony knows they have to deliver another winner.

Again, just to be clear, we’re talking about lenses as long-term investments here. The 24-70mm f/4 lens is an excellent lens, and in fact I do own it. I’m very happy with it and it fully serves my current needs, but I’m well aware of its shortcomings, and I’m prepared to part with it the day a better version is released. 

If you need a standard zoom today, there’s nothing terribly wrong with the 24-70mm f/4 lens. It’s a fine lens, and it will serve you well. But if you want your lenses to remain relevant and retain their value for a decade or more, I have to steer you away from this one. 

##Rumors of upcoming lenses

Sony has announced they will be releasing eight new FE lenses in early 2016. The list of possible candidates includes:

* More f/1.4 primes, like the long-awaited 50mm f/1.4 and 85mm f/1.4 lenses.

* More affordable primes, including possibly a 35mm f/2 lens with autofocus.

* The first f/2.8 zooms. Most likely a 24-70mm f/2.8 but also possibly a 70-200mm f/2.8 zoom.

* Some ultra-wide angle and/or super telephoto primes.

The point is, with so much movement and the FE system being in such a state of flux at the moment, it only makes sense to invest in lenses that you _know_ are top-notch, and that will remain relevant in a decade or more. Luckily, there are plenty of options to choose from already, and more seem to be on the way.


##So what do I buy first?

Now that you know what the best FE lenses are, let’s take a look at how you could build an entire kit from scratch.

If you’re just starting out your FE lens kit, I highly recommend going with the Sonnar 55mm as your first lens. This lens represents the best overall value and a great compromise between size, weight, image quality, build quality, and price. It’s an absolute stunner of a lens, and easily the best one I’ve ever used.

After that, and given that I don’t recommend buying the 24-70mm standard zoom, I would get one of the other two zoom lenses, depending on your personal preference between the wide angle or telephoto focal ranges.

Then you should probably go with the Batis lens that is opposite to the zoom you bought: if you got the 16-35mm zoom then I’d buy the 85mm Batis, and if you got the 70-200mm zoom then I’d get the 25mm Batis. The idea is to expand the range of focal lengths you have covered with each purchase. There will be a time to start duplicating focal lengths later.

By now you should own three lenses — two primes and one zoom — chosen in order to build a pretty versatile kit. The logical next step would be to buy a fast prime that’s within the same range as your existing zoom. That will get you the low light capabilities you still don’t have in that range. If you got the 70-200mm zoom earlier, the answer is the 85mm Batis, and if you bought the 16-35mm zoom instead, then you could potentially go with either the 25mm Batis or the 35mm Distagon, depending on your personal preference. You get the idea.

At this point your kit should be close to complete, so it’s up to you to decide how to round it up. Take your time to learn where you’re most comfortable, and go with your gut. Sometimes it takes a while to get used to a new focal length, so be patient and, above all, enjoy the process.


##Final words

The whole idea of looking at lenses as long-term investments is born out of necessity. Lenses are expensive pieces of equipment, and very few people can afford to be upgrading them every couple of years.

The Sony FE system is a perfect example of this philosophy. While admittedly there aren’t many lenses in the lineup yet, most of the existing ones are incredible pieces of glass. Every single one of the lenses featured in this guide offers best-in-class performance not only within the context of the FE system, but arguably across any other camera systems as well. Lenses like the 35mm Distagon, the 55mm Sonnar and the 85mm Batis have raised the bar for the industry, and we’re all better off for it.

Also, investing in high-end lenses is a great way to future-proof your kit.

Even if Sony were to release a 50mm f/1.4 lens tomorrow, the current 55mm Sonnar is still going to be awesome. Likewise, if they come up with an 85mm f/1.4 prime, that’s not going to make the 85mm Batis any worse. When you invest in quality optics, you are way less vulnerable to gear acquisition syndrome, and you can just be at peace with your equipment. 

And finally, when it’s time to sell, ten or fifteen years from now, your lenses will have retained most of their value, allowing you to reclaim a sizable part of your original investment, or to make an eventual transition to a new system a whole lot less painful for your wallet.

Camera bodies come and go, but lenses are long-term investments. Invest in top-of-the-line glass, and never look back.
