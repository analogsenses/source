<blockquote>I hereby resign as CEO of Apple. I would like to serve, if the Board sees fit, as Chairman of the Board, director and Apple employee.</blockquote>


Steve Jobs announced earlier today via a press release on Apple.com that he is officially stepping down as CEO of Apple, effective immediately. As expected, Tim Cook has been named as the new CEO by the Board of Directors.

Now, the only thing I have to say about this for now is right there in the title. Everything else is just speculation and will have to wait.

So there it goes,

Thank You, Steve.
