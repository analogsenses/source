Michael Ballaban reviews Tesla’s new autopilot system:

> And it really is eerie at first, to be sitting in the driver’s seat and see the wheel moving itself. You see massive trucks to the left, and suicidal taxis to the right, and you know, you just _know_, that you’re going to smash into one of them and face a very apologetic Tesla representative in the passenger seat.

> But you don’t. In the dash in front of you, the car actually gives you a display of what its onboard computer is seeing. You see displays of ultrasonic sensors firing off to the left and right of you, you see a generic illustration of the car in front of you halfway out of its own lane, and the car essentially reassures you – “it’s alright, I’ve got it, I see the chaotic trash soup surrounding us, and you’re not going to hit anything.”

Just crazy. Check out [the accompanying video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yCAZWdqX_Y) to get a better idea of how the system works:
