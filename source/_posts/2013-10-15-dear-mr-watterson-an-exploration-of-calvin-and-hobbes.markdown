[Dear Mr. Watterson: an exploration of Calvin and Hobbes](http://dearmrwatterson.com/store/)

Amazing new documentary about one of the greatest comic strips ever made: Calvin and Hobbes, by Bill Watterson. Available in theaters and as a digital download on iTunes on November 15. Here's the trailer:

Calvin and Hobbes is my favorite comic strip of all times. Hands down. No other strip comes even close, and there are a few great ones. But Calvin is special. Like they say in the trailer:



<blockquote>I've never met anyone who doesn't like Calvin and Hobbes. I can't say that about any other strip.</blockquote>



Exactly. Calvin and Hobbes is pure genius, art and craftsmanship at their very best. Bill Watterson is one of my heroes, and I can't wait to see this film. As an added bonus, he was born on July 5, just like me. To be honest, I can't think of better company to share a birthday with.
