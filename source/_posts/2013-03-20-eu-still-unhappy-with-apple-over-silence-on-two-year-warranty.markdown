Ars Technica:


<blockquote>The EU remains unhappy with Apple when it comes to informing customers about their right to a two-year warranty on their purchases, as reported by Dow Jones Business News. EU Justice Commissioner Viviane Reding spoke on Tuesday about Apple's warranty practices, pointing out that the company hasn't been forthcoming in making customers aware that they can get free hardware repairs past Apple's standard one-year warranty period, even after facing fines and lawsuits throughout Europe.</blockquote>



It's a pity, and it's true: most people in Europe don't know they are covered by a 2-year warranty by law. Apple could make this very clear it they wanted to, by displaying it prominently on the Apple Online Store as well as informing customers in Apple Retail Stores when they buy a product.

It's even more of a shame given that Apple is great at honoring this 2-year warranty period, far better than most manufacturers. Precisely yesterday, I kid you not, I went to an Apple Retail Store because the sleep button in my 16-month-old iPhone 4S was stuck, and they replaced the phone with a new one immediately, no questions asked. In 15 minutes I was in and out of the store with a new phone, just like that.

Alas, great customer service is meaningless if customers don't know their rights. And Apple has the responsibility here to inform its customers of that right. It's that simple.
