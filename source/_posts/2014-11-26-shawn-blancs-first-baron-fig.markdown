Shawn Blanc takes a trip down memory lane through the pages of his recently-finished [Baron Fig](http://www.baronfig.com) notebook:

> A brand new notebook is too nice to be used. Paper is so full of character. Itâ€™s tactile. Real. Fragile. Permanent and impermanent at the same time. It just begs to be used for something awesome. And I never feel that my silly ideas and temporary to-do lists qualify. But if not those, then what?

> My Baron Fig and I made a pact. I would use it for the most mundane, menial, impermanent things I could think of. And if I ruined this book by filling it with nothing of consequence, then I would order another to sit on the shelf and collect dust as it waited patiently for something more historic and epic.

> But the truth is, when it comes to using our everyday notebooks, quality is found in quantity; meaning in the mundane.

It's a beautiful article.
