Dr. Richard Berger, an orthopedic surgeon at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester:


<blockquote>“This is energy that springs from the legs, up through the spine, down the arm to the forearm and across the wrist to the racket. At some point, either through genetics or the playing style, the structural integrity of any of those structures is exceeded. For any given individual, the force is greater than the structures are capable of withstanding. That’s where the injury comes from.”</blockquote>



Tennis's evolution in the past decade has moved towards a game where it's all about overpowering and outlasting the opponent rather than outmaneuvering or outsmarting him. It may be great for spectacle, having gladiatorial-like 5-hour matches every weekend, but unfortunately, this almost-superhuman physicality has its consequences. Something needs to change.
