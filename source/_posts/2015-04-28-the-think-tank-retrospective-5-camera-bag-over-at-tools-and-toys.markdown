Speaking of [taking enough time](/2015/04/28/confirmation-bias/) before reviewing a product, I’ve been using the Think Tank Retrospective 5 camera bag for exactly a year now. Hopefully that will help keep confirmation bias in check in this review. I know I haven’t always been able to do that in the past — confirmation bias works both ways, you can totally lose objectivity by spending too much time with a product as well — but I’ve been making a conscious effort to keep things fair and in perspective for a while now.

The Retrospective 5 is not perfect, but it’s a really, really solid camera bag and fulfills a very specific role very well: it is tough, discreet and just the right size to be a great walk-around bag for everyday use. If that sounds like something you’d enjoy, go check it out.
