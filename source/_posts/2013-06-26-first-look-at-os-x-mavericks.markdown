Jim Dalrymple takes a look at a pre-release version of OS X Mavericks. I like his takeaway:



<blockquote>We use Apple products because they make it easy to access our information no matter where we are—on our MacBook, iMac or on the go with an iPhone or iPad. Everything syncs, everything is the same no matter where you are, and that’s important.</blockquote>



It's simple, really. It just works.
