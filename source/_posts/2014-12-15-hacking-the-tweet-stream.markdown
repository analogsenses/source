M.G. Siegler, on the recent trend of embedding a picture of text in a tweet to be able to tweet longer messages:

> In the age of Tweetstorms, I thought I would grow to hate this as well. But I actually quite like it. One big reason: it maintains the flow of the tweet stream. That is, it’s one tweet with a payload, so it both flows in and out of the stream just as quickly as a regular tweet. And, more importantly, it can be retweeted (another one of those early Twitter “hacks” that has [since become part of the official canon](http://techcrunch.com/2009/11/11/simple-is-as-simple-does-the-risk-of-retweet/)) and replied to without breaking context.

I'm seeing these tweets more and more in my timeline as well. I'm not crazy about it becoming a thing, but I can't say it bothers me, either.
