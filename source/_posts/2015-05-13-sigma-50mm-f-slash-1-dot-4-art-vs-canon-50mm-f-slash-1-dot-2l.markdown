Another excellent lens comparison by Matthew Gore over at _Light & Matter_, as usual. In this case, the Sigma lens practically wipes the floor with the Canon. Unless you absolutely need the shallowest depth of field possible, the Sigma 50mm f/1.4 Art appears to be best normal lens you can buy today.
