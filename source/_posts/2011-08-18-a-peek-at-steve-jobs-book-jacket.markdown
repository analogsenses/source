<blockquote>"The cover," writes Isaacson in private e-mail, "is the Albert Watson portrait taken for Fortune in 2009. The back is a Norman Seeff portrait of him in the lotus position holding the original Macintosh, which ran in Rolling Stone in January 1984. The title font is Helvetica. It will look as you see it, with no words on the back cover."</blockquote>


I love the cover design. Simple, elegant and effective. Just enough. And the pictures they chose are perfect. I know I'm in line to get one the day it goes on sale (November 21, 2011).
