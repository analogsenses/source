Typically, when we think about the Micro Four Thirds system, two names come to mind: Olympus and Panasonic. While it’s true that these two giants are the main driving force behind the system, many other manufacturers are also contributing. Storied names like Voigtländer, Sigma and Kodak will hardly sound alien to any photography enthusiast worth her salt. 

Following the title link you will find a comprehensive list of every Micro Four Thirds lens available for sale today, along with their specifications. It even includes older Four Thirds lenses, which are still compatible with the Olympus OM-D E-M1, albeit via the use of an adapter. 

You’ll be surprised to see just how many native MFT lenses are actually out there. If you’re in the market for a new lens for the system, this list could come in handy. And if you prefer a downloadable version, here's [a PDF brochure](http://www.four-thirds.org/en/common/pdf/caralog2014_en.pdf) with all the information.

Please note that the list does not include announced but still unreleased lenses, such as the new Olympus 7-14mm f/2.8 Pro zoom or the Voigtländer Nokton 10.5mm f/0.95 prime lens.
