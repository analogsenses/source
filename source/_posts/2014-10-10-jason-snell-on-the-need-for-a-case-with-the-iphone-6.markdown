> I’m with Marco. I have always appreciated using my iPhones as they were born, a [naked robotic core](http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/86) with no adornment. And I’ve never dropped one. But I’ve been using an [Apple iPhone 6 leather case](http://store.apple.com/us/product/MGR32ZM/A/iphone-6-leather-case-midnight-blue) for the last couple of weeks, and really liking it.

I've never used a case with any of my iPhones, but I've always used some sort of sleeve. I've only dropped my iPhone once in about 6 years, so I'm not terribly worried about protecting it from accidental falls. To me, casual protection from superficial damage — like scuffs and scratches, particularly on the screen — is more important. Besides, sleeves offer protection when you want it, and disappear when you don't, which to me is the best of both worlds. I have always loved the way a caseless iPhone feels in my hand.

If you're interested in trying one, here are some excellent iPhone sleeves:

* The Apple iPod socks were perfect for all 3.5-inch iPhones (from the original iPhone to the iPhone 4S). They've since been discontinued by Apple, but you can still find them [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006JMX14/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0006JMX14&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=SUAHUFRPKQLC2VYO).

* I'm also a big fan of [Sena Cases](http://www.senacases.com). The [Sena UltraSlim Access leather sleeve](http://www.senacases.com/product/ultraslim-access-iphone-5-5s/) is what I currently use on my iPhone 5S, and it's gorgeous. I really like the texture of the fine leather, and it doesn't add any bulk to the iPhone, which makes it great to carry in your pocket. 

* There are also versions of the UltraSlim [for the iPhone 5C](http://www.senacases.com/product/ultraslim-iphone-5c/), as well as [the iPhone 4/4S](http://www.senacases.com/product/ultraslim-iphone-4-4s/).

* Finally, there's the [Heritage UltraSlim](http://www.senacases.com/catalog/?q=HeritageUltraSli), which is specifically tailored to the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and looks even better. If I had an iPhone 6 I would definitely be using one of these.
