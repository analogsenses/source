Julius Motal, _The Phoblographer_:

> In this episode of ISO 400, we hear from Rinzi Ruiz, a street and wedding photographer based in Los Angeles. Towards the of 2011, Ruiz was laid off a job he had for 10 years, and this gave him time to focus on his photography. He found his zen in street photography on the streets of Los Angeles. His high contrast monochrome images are deeply meditative, and they have excellent lighting.

I absolutely love Rinzi Ruizâ€™s photographic style, and the way he paints incredible scenes with light in some of the most mundane places, like subways, coffee shops and the like.
