[Tony Stark / Bruce Banner: How $1 of great writing/acting makes $100,000 of CGI totally worth it | That is All](http://areasofmyexpertise.com/post/22590229591/i-mentioned-this-tumbl-essay-on-twitter-last)



<blockquote>First of all, their parallels. Both geniuses, top of their field. Both suffered an accident that physically changed them, forever, and not in a wholesome Spider-Man kind of way. Both try to do what they can to help others despite their own issues; Banner heals people, Tony works on developing clean energy. And both struggle, in their own way, with duality; Tony and Iron Man, Bruce and the Hulk. Two identities, one body. Only difference is Iron Manâ€™s bad side is Tony.</blockquote>



Agreed. I love how the movie portrays the relationship between the two. Kudos to Joss Whedon for an incredibly fun, entertaining and exciting film.
