<blockquote>Passion and emotion have always been my motivation for writing. I am a passionate person — we all are — and writing is one of the ways I’ve found to express those emotions. I’d like to get better at it, and slowly I am learning a little bit more every day.</blockquote>


Brave, honest, and charming the way we know him. Good luck, Shawn.

Onward!
