The Sony A7 series just got a whole lot more interesting. Sony has released a few more native lenses for their full frame mirrorless cameras, including an affordable 28mm f/2 Sony lens and a mouth-watering [Zeiss Distagon 35mm f/1.4 lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U29GNBO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00U29GNBO&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=4KNRLAR2RJGIYZCH) which, [according to Steve Huff](http://www.stevehuffphoto.com/2015/03/03/hands-on-the-sony-fe-35-1-4-lens-samples-and-my-1st-thoughts/), is the best 35mm lens heâ€™s ever shot with.

I've always liked the A7 series but up until now, I'd never really considered them a viable choice for me. That was in no small part for the lack of a truly outstanding 35mm lens for the system, which is the single biggest complaint I still have about Micro Four Thirds. With this release, Sony scores a huge win in my book. Next time I'm in the market for a serious camera, I'll make sure I take a good long look at them, because this changes everything.
