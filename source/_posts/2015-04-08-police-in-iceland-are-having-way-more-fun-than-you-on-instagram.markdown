Messy Nessy:

> I didn’t even know police forces having instagram accounts was a thing, but apparently it is. The [NYPD](https://instagram.com/officialnypd/) even has time for one. But no one gets it quite like the official Instagram account of the [Reykjavík metropolitan police](https://instagram.com/logreglan/). From silly selfless, posing with adorable kittens to re-enacting their own scenes from Baywatch and using all the right hashtags, the charming coppers of Iceland’s capital have accumulated more than 144K instagram followers– that’s even more than the total population of Reykjavík (around 118k).

Kind of puts a few things in perspective, doesn’t it?
