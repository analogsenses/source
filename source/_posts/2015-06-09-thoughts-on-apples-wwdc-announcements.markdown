Every year, when June rolls around, the same story repeats itself. The geek community reaches peak enthusiasm in the days prior to Appleâ€™s WWDC in anticipation of the keynote address that kickstarts the conference and that Apple has traditionally used to unveil new versions of their operating systems, along with a few surprises every now and then.

This year the story was no different, and the keynote went exactly as expected. We got new versions of OS X, iOS and for the first time ever, watchOS. On the surprises front, we got a new app and publishing service called News, and a new music streaming, radio and social service called, well, Music.[^WWDC1] And on the not-really-surprises area, we got the promised Watch SDK, which will allow developers to write native apps for the Apple Watch.

[^WWDC1]: Not very original, but it does beats Ping, so thereâ€™s that.

Of course, not every announcement was equally important, nor received with the same enthusiasm by the developer crowd that filled Moscone West, but that is how these things usually work. Letâ€™s take a closer look at each of the main announcements and see what they promise to bring to the table.


##OS X El Capitan

Let's just say it upfront: El Capitan is a _terrible_ name for an operating system. Sorry, but it just is. Alright, moving on.
