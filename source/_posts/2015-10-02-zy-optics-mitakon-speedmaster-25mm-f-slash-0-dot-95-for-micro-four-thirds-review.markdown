Micro Four Thirds users finally have an affordable f/0.95 prime lens and, judging by this great review over at _MirrorLessons_, it punches well above its weight:

> The good news is that, at close range, the lens is already quite sharp at the centre at f/0.95 and continues to grow sharper up until f/2.8 where it reaches its peak performance. The lens remains reasonably sharp up until f/8, at which point diffraction starts to set in. Corner sharpness is quite poor at all apertures except f/8, f/11 and f/16 but this is less of a concern for close-up work where out-of-focus edges can actually contribute to the artistic look of an image.

Of course, that's not to say it is without imperfections. Extreme lens design comes at a cost, and in this case, flare and chromatic aberration seem to be two of the most severe flaws of the lens. That said, if you require the speed and you can live with some of these flaws, this appears to be quite the bargain.

The only real alternatives are [the Voigtlander 25mm f/0.95](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046EC1OE/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0046EC1OE&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=JDT45MIKD3OQGGBA) and the [SLR Magic 25mm T0.95 HyperPrime Cine II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CHX5EEK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CHX5EEK&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=GZU46QMI22FAFIBE) lenses, both of which are beasts, comparatively, and cost over twice as much as the Mitakon.

I have a soft spot in my heart for the Voigtlander primes, but even I have to admit that at less than half the price, the Mitakon is probably the better buy for most people.
