What better way to celebrate the site's birthday than by sharing a great article by Patrick Rhone: 

> I think there an increasingly prevailing notion that the internet, wifi, or some other new technology automatically makes everything better. That adding more technology means convenience or ease of use. It doesnâ€™t. And, in many cases it means the exact opposite. It means one more point of failure or one more thing to manage or one more corporation to be beholden too. In many cases, sticking the internet into the middle of things makes them worse.

Exactly. Technology just for technology's sake is never the right answer.

Patrick has been a huge source of inspiration for me since [the very first day](http://www.analogsenses.com/2009/11/10/239397612/). Thanks to kind, generous people like him, the Internet is a better place.

Thank you, Patrick. For everything. 

Let's keep the words flowing.
