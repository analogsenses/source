I only recently discovered the work of Zaron Burnett III and I have to say, the man can write:

> Now, she was single. And I had just moved in with my best friend — her former roommate. Within days of settling in my new home, the three of us got together for drinks at her place up in the Berkeley hills. It was a tiny place. But that was okay because so was she. After our night of drinking and laughing, all three of us crashed out on her bed. My friend was the first asleep and began to snore. She was in the middle. I lay there staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep. Because her.

I don’t want to spoil any more of it for you, just go read the whole thing. So good.

If you want to read more of his work, check out [his other articles on Medium](https://medium.com/@zaron3), and [his books on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/s/?_encoding=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&field-author=Zaron%20Burnett%20III&linkCode=ur2&search-alias=digital-text&sort=relevancerank&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=NO654RBTPITIEV4F). At under $13 for all three, they’re a steal. I just bought them.
