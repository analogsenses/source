> This is the end of day three of me sitting in a chair in my garage and writing things and doing podcasts and calling that my job, instead of sitting in an office building in San Francisco and doing various things and calling that my job.

I'm really sorry for how things ended at Macworld, but I'm so glad we have [Six Colors](http://sixcolors.com/post/2014/09/big-week-huge-week/) now. Jason's work is amazing and inspiring, and I couldn't imagine the Apple community without him.

Here's to many more awesome weeks, Jason.
