Chris Gampat, The Phoblographer:

> The only word that we can use to describe this camera’s build quality is beautiful. Well, that’s a lie. You can also use timeless, ruggedized, expert, fine, and nostalgic. Veteran Leica shooters will feel right at home with this little piece of art in their hands. Photographers that have shot for many years and experimented with various cameras will also be caught smitten.

> Of anything that Leica has pushed out of its factories in the past years, this camera’s build quality and design is something that we’d truly state is worth its weight in gold due to it being truly timeless and purely analog.

Sounds like my kind of camera.
