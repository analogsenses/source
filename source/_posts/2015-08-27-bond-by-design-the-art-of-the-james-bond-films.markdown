Gorgeous upcoming book on the art and design of the EON Productions’ James Bond films:

> Accessing EON Productions’ vast archive of more than 50 years of art and design, featuring the work of legendary Bond film designers such as Ken Adam, Peter Lamont and Syd Cain. The book provides a unique, spectacular and fascinating insight into the longest-running film franchise of all time. Reveals the craft behind the creation of famous sets, such as Stromberg’s _Atlantis_ base in _The Spy Who Loved Me_ and Drax’s shuttle launch site in _Moonraker_, as well as technical drawings of Bond’s gadget-laden Aston Martin DB5. Includes two exclusive, full-colour prints of Bond film designs.

> Bond By Design also brings the James Bond story right up to date with behind-the-scenes artwork from the newest film, _SPECTRE_.

Bond films have always featured impressive set designs, and this book gives an incredible sneak peek at the creative process behind it all. A must-have for all design-conscious Bond fans out there.

The book will be released in the U.S. on October 6. You can preorder it on Amazon [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1465437908/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1465437908&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=3UI3KDW264PSJKX6).
