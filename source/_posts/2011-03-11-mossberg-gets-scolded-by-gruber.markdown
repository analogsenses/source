[Mossberg gets scolded by Gruber | Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/2011/03/bending_over_backwards)


<blockquote>Walt Mossberg has a 500-word section on “Drawbacks” in his review today of the iPad 2. The whole thing is a crock, an example of trying to be fair/balanced/objective by bending over backwards to find negative things to say about the device. No one is arguing that the iPad 2 is beyond criticism. But almost nothing in Mossberg’s list of drawbacks is valid.</blockquote>


I love Walt Mossberg, I think he's one of the best at what he does. However, it doesn't matter how long you've been doing something, or how respected and admired you are, you need to stay focused. If you write something that doesn't make any sense, people will notice. And they will call you on it.

Gruber here does just that.
