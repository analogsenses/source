<blockquote>After testing a feature and evaluating its merits, if we learn it doesn’t improve the user experience or serve our mission, we’ll remove that feature. Rather than continue to make changes to the QuickBar as it exists, we removed the bar from the update appearing in the App Store today.</blockquote>


Interesting move, even if it's heavily PR-motivated. It takes guts to recognize a mistake. At least this shows two things: 1) Twitter still listens to its users; and 2) they are not nearly as dumb as people thought lately.
