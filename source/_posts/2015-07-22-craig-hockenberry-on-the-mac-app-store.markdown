Craig Hockenberry:

> It doesn’t take a genius to see that Apple is doing something it rarely does: a half-assed job.

> As developers, we completely understand how much work it is to announce these kinds of initiatives and get them working on multiple platforms. It’s not easy and takes a lot of resources. But it’s clear that these precious resources are not being allocated.

He makes a compelling argument that Apple’s continued neglect of the Mac App Store is hurting developers, users, and ultimately Apple itself.
