This week Marius and I do our best to catch up on the deluge of photo news from the week. The Panasonic GH5, Kodak’s Ektachrome revival, and DJI’s supposed transition to Hasselblad ownership are all addressed, along with a wishlist for Adobe Lightroom in 2017. 

Also, don’t forget to join the conversation in our new public [Slack channel](https://goo.gl/forms/3eFt4JIdnliuFSHK2)! We already have a great community, and it’s growing every day. See you there!
