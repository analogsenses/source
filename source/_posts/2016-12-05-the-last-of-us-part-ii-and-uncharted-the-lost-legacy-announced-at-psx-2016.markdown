I must have been living under a rock all weekend, because I only just now came across these announcements. I can’t even begin to describe how excited I am about this one in particular:

[_The Last of Us_](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B00JK00S0S&uk=B00LWRSJB2&es=B00JLB8M1I) is hands down my favorite video game of all time, and its long-awaited sequel is looking every bit as awesome as I had hoped.

If you want to know more about the game, take a look at this PSX panel featuring Neil Druckmann, Ashley Johnson, Troy Baker, and Game Informer’s Andy McNamara. Great stuff:

If that wasn’t enough to make your day, you’re in luck, because we also got [a new _Uncharted_ game announcement](http://blog.us.playstation.com/2016/12/03/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-arrives-next-year-on-ps4/). While technically a DLC, _Uncharted: The Lost Legacy_ will be available as a standalone game purchase, and stars one of the most popular characters in the franchise — perhaps the one big character who didn’t appear on [_Uncharted 4_](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B00GODZYNA&uk=B00KW6W8VQ&es=B00JZPEHCS). Can you guess who it is?

This one’s also looking _very_ impressive. I particularly love the change in tone and mechanics, with a lot more sneaking around. I think it’s going to be a fantastic game. Of course, there was also a PSX panel about this one, featuring Sid Shuman, the creative team at Naughty Dog, and actors Claudia Black (Chloe) and Laura Bailey (Nadine).

Now, if we could just fast forward a couple years into the future, to a day when both of these games have already been released, that’d be great, thanksverymuch.
