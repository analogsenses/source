[Making changes | Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/making-changes/)

Matt Gemmell explains the reasons behind his career transition into writing full-time. Refreshingly honest article, as usual:



<blockquote>I’m scared, but being scared isn’t the same as being unsure. I was a programmer for a living, but for better or for worse, I’m meant to be a writer. </blockquote>



You should read the entire article to truly appreciate the thought and care that went into this decision. I wish Matt only the best, and I'm deeply grateful for his contribution to the tech community over the years. But as he said himself, he was always going to be a writer in the end. Those of us who have been reading along for a while already knew on some level that this day would come, eventually. And I, for one, could not be more excited about it. I think he's going to be a terrific writer, quite simply because in my book he already is.

Now it's time to support his dream by [becoming a patron of his writing](http://www.patreon.com/mattgemmell). I'm putting my money where my mouth is and already signed up. If you appreciate great writing and want to see more of it, you should too.
