John Gruber on the intrinsic risks associated with cloud-based backups:

> It is thus, in my opinion, terribly irresponsible to advise people to blindly not trust Apple (or Google, or Dropbox, or Microsoft, etc.) with “any of your data” without emphasizing, clearly and adamantly, that by only storing their data on-device, they greatly increase the risk of losing everything.

Well said. "Just don't put your stuff in the cloud" is about the worst advice you can give.
