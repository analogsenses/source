MirrorLessons continues their series of reviews of the spectacular Voigtlander primes for the Micro Four Thirds system. This time around it’s the [42.5mm f/0.95](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00EHG419Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00EHG419Y&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=C3IHTDIXWK2URMMO) and by the looks of it, it didn’t disappoint.

> On one hand, I loved the purely mechanical build of the Voigtlander 42.5mm f/0.95 and the accuracy of the manual focus ring. The 0.95 aperture makes subject isolation a breeze and the bokeh is as creamy as custard. On the other, I’d be reluctant to give up autofocus completely. And with offerings like the M.Zuiko 45mm f/1.8 and Nocticron 42.5mm f/1.2 on the market, it is possible to have a very fast aperture, beautiful bokeh and that razor-like sharpness that is so desirable from a portrait lens.

One thing to keep in mind when considering these specialty lenses is that they’re not about technical perfection, but about character. Clinically sharp lenses can actually have a detrimental effect on certain types of photography, and portraiture is probably the best example of that. Once a lens is so sharp that it starts revealing imperfections, the overall effect may stop being pleasant and cross the line into unflattering territory. 

Yes, the [Panasonic Nocticron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HXE4GZQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HXE4GZQ&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=3ZTANEHPRLQG6QCD) is sharper, especially in the corners, but it’s so clinically perfect that in some cases its images can look a bit artificial. The same thing has been said about the [Olympus 75mm f/1.8](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CI3TQSO/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CI3TQSO&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=MP5LESTEWJSGSLYC). 

Those lenses may be technically better, and they’re definitely amazing, but none of them can match the character and unique look of the Voigtlander primes.[^Voigt1] Much like in life certain flaws can add to a person’s character, in photography perfection is rarely what makes for an interesting photograph.

[^Voigt1]: In their defense, these lenses have unique looks of their own, and many people even prefer them to the Voigtlanders. It’s largely a matter of personal preference.
