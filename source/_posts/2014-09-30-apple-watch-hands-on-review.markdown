> Yes, of course the Apple Watch is a "watch." Many people, especially in the watch community, have defended their love of traditional mechanical watches by segmenting the Apple Watch in a category of high-end gadgets versus "watches." While I understand and perhaps even empathize with this sentiment, I disagree. If anything, the Apple Watch is what the wrist watch is meant to be in the 21st century. You might not like that, but it is the truth, when it comes to wearable wrist technology. Traditional watch lovers know (and even relish the fact) that their timepieces employ antiquated technology. Such technology might be produced using the most modern construction equipment and with innovative materials, but at the end of the day, no one can argue that a mechanical wrist watch would be able to compete with the sheer utility of a computer.

That is a very good point. The day that modern smartwatch technology is able to match the craftsmanship of mechanical watches, I'll be happily won over in a heartbeat.

All in all, a really great, in-depth article. It is well worth your time.
