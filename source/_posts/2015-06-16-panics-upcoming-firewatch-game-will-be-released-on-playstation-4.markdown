Cabel Sasser:

> We’ve already announced that Firewatch will be coming first to the Mac and PC. (And at WWDC we [announced](https://twitter.com/panic/status/607963655741784064) that the Mac version will **support Metal** for ultimate performance and fidelity! We’re really excited about this.)

> But we just announced the other half of the equation…

> **Firewatch will also be coming to your PlayStation 4.**

Great news, and yet another perfectly good reason to buy a PS4. I’m still living happily with my PS3, but some of these recent announcements are making my 1-click-buying finger extremely nervous. Check out the trailer they put together for Sony’s E3 keynote:

I can’t wait to get my hands on this game.
