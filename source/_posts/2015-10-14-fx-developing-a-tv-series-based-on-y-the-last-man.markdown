Great news over at _The Mary Sue_. It appears one of my favorite graphic novels is going to make its way to the small screen soon. Jessica Lachenal:

> For those of you who don’t know, _Y: The Last Man_ is a series of graphic novels revolving around a singular premise: a mysterious virus has killed all men on Earth except for one man. It’s an _amazing_ novel, one that you absolutely should pick up reading _now_, with a really gripping story that explores the dynamics of gender roles in a world where there are no more men.

Yep. I can’t wait.
