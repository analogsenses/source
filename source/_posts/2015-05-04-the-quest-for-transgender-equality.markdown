Fantastic new series over at _The New York Times_:

> Being transgender today remains unreasonably and unnecessarily hard. But it is far from hopeless. More Americans who have wrestled with gender identity are transitioning openly, propelling [a civil rights movement](http://transequality.org/) that has struggled even as gays and lesbians have reached irreversible momentum [in their fight for equality](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/opinion/a-landmark-gay-marriagecase-at-the-supreme-court.html). Those coming out now are doing so with trepidation, realizing that while pockets of tolerance are expanding, discriminatory policies and hostile, uninformed attitudes remain widespread.

> They deserve to come out in a nation where stories of compassion and support vastly outnumber those that end with a suicide note. The tide is shifting, but far too slowly, while lives, careers and dreams hang in the balance.

So great. The Times at its best.
