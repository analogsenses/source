<blockquote>The app will feature two major changes when the next update ships: you wonâ€™t be able to use the app if nobody is nearby, and Color will be changing the distance required for somebody to be considered nearby.</blockquote>


The [App Store description](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/color/id427763573?mt=8&ls=1) has this wonderful message right on the first line:


<blockquote>WARNING: DON'T USE COLOR ALONE.</blockquote>


At first, I thought it was a joke. But it looks like they were _dead_ serious.
