Well, it definitely looks... interesting:

I’m of the opinion that, even when his movies are terrible, Michael Fassbender as an actor can do no wrong. That said, I keep struggling to picture him as Steve Jobs, and this teaser has done little to erase my doubts. I just don’t quite see it yet.

This will probably be one of the most challenging roles in Fassbender’s career and considering his history, that’s saying a lot. Given the fiasco that was the first Steve Jobs movie I’m not overly optimistic, but I can’t wait for him to prove me wrong.

Which, time and time again, somehow and against all odds, he invariably does.
