If you’re into film photography but can’t find a laboratory that will process color negative film for you, you may want to look into processing it yourself at home. Luckily, this article by Sam Agnew has everything you need to know. Via [The Phoblographer](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2015/04/13/easy-c-41-colour-negative-film-processing-home/#.VSvbOM45zzM).

It may look daunting at first but don’t be discouraged. All it takes is some basic equipment and you don’t even need a darkroom. Other than the temperature-sensitive nature of the process — all liquids must be kept at precisely 40 degrees Celsius — it really is pretty simple. And as a side benefit, it will be a _lot_ cheaper than having a lab do it for you.

I myself did it for the first time last week, except with black and white film. There are a few differences: temperatures are lower for black and white — around 20C — and the whole process takes quite a bit longer, but in essence it’s the same thing.

I’m very happy with my results, and I fully intend to keep doing it from now on — but more on that later.
