Sebastian Anthony, over at _Ars Technica UK_:

> The Internet has claimed one of its highest profile victims yet: As of March 2016, _Playboy_ magazine will no longer feature fully nude models. This follows on from August last year, when the _Playboy_ website also stopped publishing nude photos and videos. Yes, you’ll now be able to read Hugh Hefner’s flagship publication, which published its first nude centrefold way back in 1953, just for the articles.

> Speaking to _The New York Times_, _Playboy_ CEO Scott Flanders explained the reasoning behind the change: “You’re now one click away from every sex act imaginable for free. And so it’s just passé at this juncture.” Basically, _Playboy_ stems from a time when nudity was racy and exciting; today, it’s _de rigueur_. The circulation figures illustrate that fact nicely: from a peak of around 5.6 million subscribers in 1975, _Playboy_ is now down to around 800,000.

Surprising, to say the least, but also understandable. Nudity used to be edgy, but clearly it isn’t anymore. The real question is, will _Playboy_ be able to reinvent themselves convincingly enough to be successful in this new, highly competitive, digital-first era?
