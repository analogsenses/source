Ben Schiller:

> The report from [Portland State University](http://www.fastcoexist.com/organization/portland-state-university) looks at eight “[Green Lane](http://www.peopleforbikes.org/green-lane-project)” projects sponsored by PeopleForBikes, an [advocacy](http://www.fastcoexist.com/explore/advocacy) group in Colorado. Researchers tracked the impact of the new lanes in Austin, Chicago, Portland (Oregon), San Francisco, and Washington, D.C., by analyzing camera footage, interviewing cyclists, and sending out surveys to local residents.

> Almost half of riders said they were cycling more frequently as a result of the new lanes, with those on Dearborn Street, in Chicago, reporting the biggest increase. Most importantly, the research found that the lanes increased participation in cycling generally. Ten percent of cyclists said they would have used another form of [transportation](http://www.fastcoexist.com/explore/transportation) before the lanes were built.

I could be wrong, but this sounds pretty logical to me.
