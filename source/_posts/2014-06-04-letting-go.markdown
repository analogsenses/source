[Letting go | Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/letting-go/)



<blockquote>You definitely can’t work effectively when you’re angry, or drained, or upset, or depressed. I don’t subscribe to the ‘acquired immunity’ theory of personal experience, where we must be endlessly tempered by disagreement and adversity; that’s another thing that we take too far. I don’t want to be exposed in the first place – because I’d rather be making something I truly care about.</blockquote>



Matt is absolutely killing it lately.
