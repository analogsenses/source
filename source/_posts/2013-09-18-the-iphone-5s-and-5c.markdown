Great insight and very thorough analysis from Gruber, as usual. The whole article is great, absolutely worth reading in spite of its length. However, this bit really takes the cake. Just how fast is the iPhone 5S, really?



<blockquote>To put that in context, the iPhone 5S beats my 2008 15-inch MacBook Pro by a small measure in the Sunspider benchmark (with the MacBook Pro running the latest Safari 6.1 beta). The iPhone 5S is, in some measures, computationally superior to the top-of-the-line MacBook Pro from just five years ago. In your fucking pocket.</blockquote>



In your fucking pocket. 

'Nuff said.
