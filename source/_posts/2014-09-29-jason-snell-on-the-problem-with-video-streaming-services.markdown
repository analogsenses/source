> The point is, if you’re a Netflix subscriber—or an Amazon Prime customer, for that matter—you are binge-watching in a Barcalounger in a rumpus room built on shifting sands. If your service and the owner of the content can’t come to an agreement, if some competitor swoops in offering more money for exclusive rights, you’re out of luck. The rug can, and will, be pulled out from under you.

He has a point. I have a Spotify subscription and every time I come across an album or a song I like, I buy it so that I can own it forever. As far as video goes, there are currently no streaming video services operating in Spain, but if there was one, I'd probably approach it with the same strategy. I don't like surprises when it comes to my digital media collection.

I also happen to have a totally redundant and unnecessarily excessive backup strategy for my media files, but that's a story for another day.
