Stunning photo-essay by Jorge Quinteros for _Tools & Toys_:

> [Cub and Co](http://cubandcompany.com/) primarily make leather camera straps. They started like most great ideas do: in someone’s basement. The company was founded by graphic designer and videographer Joel Chavez, who goes by the moniker “Street Cub”. Recently, I met up with Joel, his colleagues, and the amazing crew at [Knickerbocker](http://knickerbockermfg.co/pages/backstory) — an American manufacturing company based in New York who collaborate alongside with Joel — and I caught a glimpse of what things look like behind the scenes.

Man, those camera straps look positively _gorgeous_.
