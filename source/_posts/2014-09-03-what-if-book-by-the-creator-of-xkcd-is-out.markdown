Here's all you need to know about it:

> Serious scientific answers to absurd hypothetical questions.

["What If?"](http://whatif.xkcd.com/) is a [frequent](/2013/03/27/ships) [favorite](/2013/03/27/leap-seconds) of mine. This book is a compilation of the best answers from the blog, but it also contains several new questions. I've already ordered mine, and I can't wait for it to be delivered.

Highly recommended.
