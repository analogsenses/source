Windows 10 was released worldwide today, and Peter Bright has already penned a great review of it over at _Ars Technica_:

> I’m more conflicted about Windows 10 than I have been about any previous version of Windows. In some ways, the operating system is extremely ambitious; in others, it represents a great loss of ambition. The new release tries to walk an unsteady path between being Microsoft’s most progressive, forward-looking release and simultaneously appealing to Windows’ most conservative users.

> And it mostly succeeds, making this the best version of Windows yet—once everything’s working. In its current form, the operating system doesn’t feel quite finished, and I’d wait a few weeks before making the leap.

Despite the initial bugs, which are always to be expected, it seems like a solid update for Windows users. It also happens to be the first free version of Windows, so this is great news for consumers.
