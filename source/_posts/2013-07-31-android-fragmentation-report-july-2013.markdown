[Android Fragmentation Report July 2013 | OpenSignal](http://opensignal.com/reports/fragmentation-2013/)



<blockquote>Android devices come in all shapes and sizes, with vastly different performance levels and screen sizes. Furthermore, there are many different versions of Android that are concurrently active at any one time, adding another level of fragmentation. What this means is that developing apps that work across the whole range of Android devices can be extremely challenging and time-consuming.</blockquote>



Other than that though, developing for Android is great!
