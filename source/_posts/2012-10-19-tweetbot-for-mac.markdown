[Tweetbot for Mac is available on the Mac App Store | Tapbots](http://tapbots.com/software/tweetbot/mac/)



<blockquote>Tweetbot is a full-featured Twitter app for the Mac based on the award-winning apps for iPhone and iPad. With retina support, sync via iCloud, and multiple column views, Tweetbot is the premier Twitter app for the Mac.</blockquote>



Instant buy. It may seem a bit expensive for a Twitter client but trust me, it's worth every penny. [I like how Gruber puts it](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2012/10/18/tweetbot-mac):



<blockquote>$20 for a Twitter client? Damn straight. Screw the race to the bottom. Iâ€™m happy to pay for quality work.</blockquote>
