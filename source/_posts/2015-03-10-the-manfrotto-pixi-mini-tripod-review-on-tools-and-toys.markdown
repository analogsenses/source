Great review of this awesome little tripod by Josh Ginter. As great as the [SIRUI T-025X](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/sirui-t-025x-travel-tripod/) travel tripod is, it's still too large to be with you at all times, and that's where pocket tripods like the PIXI come in. When you just want to go for a nice photo walk without carrying all your equipment with you, having a diminutive tripod like this one discreetly stowed in one of your bag's pockets is probably the perfect solution. And at $25, it really is a no-brainer.
