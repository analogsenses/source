A very smart take by Harry McCracken on how Steve Jobs is frequently seen, in retrospect, as the man that revolutionized a new industry every two years. The reality though, is that he was as much an advocate of refinement through iteration as Tim Cook is now:



<blockquote>Back to incrementalism. I don’t understand why Cannold — and plenty of others — think that it’s at odds with Steve Jobs’ legacy. For every great leap forward Apple ever made, it accomplished at least as much through small steps that made its products easier, faster, thinner, lighter, more polished and/or more useful. Apple’s most important products may have been the game-changers, but its best products, always, have been those that benefited from smart, evolutionary improvements. And as far as I remember, Jobs never seemed guilty about the profits they brought.</blockquote>
