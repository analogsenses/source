In Apple’s officially sanctioned terminology:

> **Vintage products** are those that have not been manufactured for more than five and less than seven years ago.

That means my beloved Early-2008, 24" iMac is now officially a vintage Mac. Alas, it also means it’s no longer serviced by Apple. Can’t win them all, I guess.

In all seriousness, this iMac is unkillable. Almost 8 years after I bought it, it continues to be my main Mac, and thanks to [the SSD upgrade](/2014/05/21/upgrading-my-early-2008-24-imac-to-an-ssd/) I installed last year, it actually performs better than it ever did. 

I have no need for a new desktop Mac, but with Apple eliminating support for my iMac, my last lifeline has now been officially removed. Which kind of sucks, even if it’s entirely understandable — this thing used to have a 500GB internal spinning hard disk, for crying out loud.

I’m a big fan of [DIY repairs](https://www.ifixit.com), but everything has its limits. I’m afraid next time something goes wrong with my iMac, it will finally die for good. After everything it’s endured, it will be a well-deserved rest.
