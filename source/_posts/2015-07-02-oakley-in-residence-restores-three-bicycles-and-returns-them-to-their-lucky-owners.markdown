[Oakley in Residence](http://www.oakley.com/in-residence) is a hybrid between coffee shop and bike workshop that visits different places around the world. Previously based in Los Angeles, Oakley in Residence is now in London, where it will remain until the end of August.

This is clearly a publicity stunt, but a pretty cool one at that. There's nothing quite like the feeling of reuniting with your long-lost bicycle. Kudos to Oakley for coming up with this.
