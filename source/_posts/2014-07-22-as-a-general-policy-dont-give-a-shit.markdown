["As a general policy, don’t give a shit" | Raptitude](http://www.raptitude.com/2014/07/not-giving-a-shit/)

David Cain:


<blockquote>I have known people who will tell stories, repeatedly, about some unpleasant twenty-second interaction that happened to them years ago, and which they evidently never stopped giving a shit about. I’m sure you have witnessed this too. Don’t fall for this madness. As a general policy, don’t give a shit.</blockquote>



I've long subscribed to this policy and in my experience, life gets a lot easier when you just don't give a shit.
