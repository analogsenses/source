Great overview by Federico of one of the apps that were demoed on-stage during Apple's iPad event. It looks like an amazing app and I'm really excited to try it, but I fear these photo-editing apps won't be particularly useful to me until they're able to handle RAW files.

Which is to say, not anytime soon, sadly.
