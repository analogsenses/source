[RIP Zune Player, 2006-2011 | Mashable.com](http://mashable.com/2011/03/14/rip-zune-player-2006-2011/)


<blockquote>Microsoft is not planning on releasing any further Zune devices. Instead, the company plans to focus on Zune software for smartphones.</blockquote>


Further proof that technology by itself is not enough, it needs to be aimed at humans.Â Microsoft never really understood that with the Zune. From what I've heard, they're trying to change course with Windows Phone 7, and they seem to be on the right track.
