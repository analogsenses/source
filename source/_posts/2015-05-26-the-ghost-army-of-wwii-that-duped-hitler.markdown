Messy Nessy Chic:

> Using dummy tanks, cannons, jeeps and trucks, fake aircrafts, phony radio transmissions and special effects, this small group of American soldiers pretended to be two divisions of up to 30,000 allied troops moving in for the attack, when in actual fact, the real attack (with real tanks and artillery) was going to take place miles away.

> Surely though, a few inflatable tanks and trucks couldnâ€™t fool Hitler and his army in their final stand?

> But the Ghost Army was so much more than that.

Super cool story.
