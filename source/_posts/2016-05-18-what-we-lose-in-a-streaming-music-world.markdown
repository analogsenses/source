Solid essay by Richard J. Anderson on the likely implications of the music industry changing from a streaming-first to a streaming-only business model:

> It feels like the move to streaming music means we’re losing something. What happens to music that isn’t available on a streaming service? How will you explore the music of a surprisingly good opening band when they don’t exist in the library of Apple Music, Spotify, or TIDAL? So much music that has touched my soul, you can’t stream it for love or money. I had to seek it out on my own, pawing through used music bins, or going to shows. When there’s an all-you-can eat buffet for $9.99, what’s the incentive to order something that isn’t on the menu?

Excellent point. The convenience of music streaming services like Spotify or Apple Music cannot be overstated, but I love owning my music, and I’m not about to stop doing it anytime soon.
