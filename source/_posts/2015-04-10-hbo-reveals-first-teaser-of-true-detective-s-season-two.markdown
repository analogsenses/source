It looks good. Very good:

My first impressions are twofold:

1. I like the new cast, particularly Rachel McAdams as the female lead, and I've had a soft spot for Kelly Reilly ever since I first saw her in [_The Spanish Apartment_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0283900/). The male characters are also well cast in my opinion. I’m not so sure about Taylor Kitsch, but I’m a huge fan of Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn.

2. That’s all well and good, but we were promised a new season featuring two female leads, and in the end we got three male and one female as the lead characters — Kelly Reilly was cast in a supporting role, apparently. I’m not saying that’s necessarily bad, but I was already expecting a different type of story and to be honest, I was quite excited about it.

But like I said, it looks _very_ good. I can’t wait.
