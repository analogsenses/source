[iPad 2 Sold Out, 70% Went to New Buyers | Mashable.com](http://mashable.com/2011/03/14/ipad-2-sold-out/)


<blockquote>Munster estimates Apple sold 400,000 to 500,000 iPad 2s, which would mean the device has fared better than the original iPad, 300,000 of which were sold in its opening weekend.</blockquote>


This is only a preliminary report, but still, it's scary. We should have official numbers by Apple pretty soon, but the Apple Online Store [is reporting](http://store.apple.com/us/browse/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad/select?mco=MjE0OTI0MDI) shipping estimates of 3-4 weeks, which seems to confirm that Apple has, in fact, ran out of iPad 2's on its opening weekend.

Not a great day to be Motorola, I guess.
