[The Making of Pulp Fiction: Quentin Tarantino’s and the Cast’s Retelling | Vanity Fair](http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2013/03/making-of-pulp-fiction-oral-history)

And this, my friends, is why I love movies. A fun teaser:



<blockquote>“In comes Sam with a burger in his hand and a drink in the other hand and stinking like fast food,” says Richard Gladstein. “Me and Quentin and Lawrence were sitting on the couch, and he walked in and just started sipping that shake and biting that burger and looking at all of us. I was scared shitless. I thought that this guy was going to shoot a gun right through my head. His eyes were popping out of his head. And he just stole the part.” Lawrence Bender adds, “He was the guy you see in the movie. He said, ‘Do you think you’re going to give this part to somebody else? I’m going to blow you motherfuckers away.’ ”</blockquote>
