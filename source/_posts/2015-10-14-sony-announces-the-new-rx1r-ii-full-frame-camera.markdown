Today Sony announced the new RX1R II, the next Full Frame camera in Sony’s RX1 series. As the previous versions, the new RX1R II sports a fixed Zeiss Sonnar T* 35mm f/2 lens. The new version, however, also sports a back-illuminated 42.4 MP sensor and the world’s first optical variable low-pass filter, which can be tuned to reduce moiré and color artifacts, or to maximize resolution.

Additionally, there’s an advanced AF system with 399 phase-detection points that cover a wide area of the image, and a retractable EVF with an impressive 0.74x magnification. 

All in all, the camera is an impressive technological feat, but there’s a catch: the RX1R II will be released in November for a whopping $3,300 in the US. Ouch.

That’s a pretty steep price point for a fixed lens camera, no doubt, although one could argue that, since you’re getting a superb piece of glass included in the package, it’s ultimately not as terrible a deal as it may initially seem.

Indeed, the RX1R II’s price translates roughly to paying $2,300 for the body and $1,000 for the lens, which are both much more reasonable amounts, especially considering that this is practically an [A7R II](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZDWGFR2/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00ZDWGFR2&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=2W4ZAQZA6ASNNVPU) with a fixed lens and without the 5-axis IBIS — which, to be honest, is not really a must-have at this focal length.

At the end of the day, this is yet another excellent camera from Sony, and at this point I’m starting to lose the count.
