Graham Spencer, MacStories:

> I wasn’t sure exactly where it would lead, but last month I asked on Twitter for independent developers [to @ reply me and say hi](https://twitter.com/greyham/status/544857987035062272). Amplified by retweets by Federico and many others, I got dozens and dozens of replies, ultimately totalling just under 200 responses. That’s both a pretty huge number (trust me, it was a time consuming process documenting them all) and also incredibly tiny (there are around [250,000 active developers and over a million apps](http://blog.appfigures.com/app-stores-growth-accelerates-in-2014/) for sale).

What a great idea. If you want to help support indie app development — and you totally should — remember to check this list the next time you’re in the market for a new app.
