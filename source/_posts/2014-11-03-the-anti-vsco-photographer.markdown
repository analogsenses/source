Great piece by Connor McClure. It's from back in February but it's still pretty relevant today, particularly in light of [the last entry](/2014/11/03/first-impressions-of-the-leica-m-a/):

> Droppping $50, $90, $120 on the latest and greatest pack of presets won't make you a better photographer any more than buying dropping an extra grand for an extra f-stop will. If you're truly in pursuit of the "film look," for heaven's sake, shoot film! If you're truly limited by your post-processing capabilities, improve them!

> We, as a creative whole, need to get out of the mindset that we must have the latest and greatest tools to be good at our craft.

Yep.
