Dave Wiskus and Jaimee Newberry’s new show is awesome:

> So we decided to make it asynchronous and put it all on video. Inspired by [John and Hank Green](http://youtube.com/vlogbrothers), we’re sending each other weekly video postcards via our new YouTube channel, called Hovercraft to Paris. This is an experiment, and all we have right now is the starting point: a conversation between friends. Like the best conversations between friends, it could go anywhere.

Sold.
