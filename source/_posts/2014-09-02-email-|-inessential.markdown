Brent Simmons tries to come up with a communication system for easily exchanging links over the Internet:

> There’s no technical reason why that specific use case — message with link, no subject line, quick to find contact, quick to write and send — couldn’t be handled by email. The issue is user interface.

> It continues to surprise me that email app vendors don’t think about the way people communicate now. They may think about the way people communicate by email but they don’t think about how people communicate in general.

Excellent point. This is an intriguing idea, and I wonder why nobody has tried to run away with it yet.
