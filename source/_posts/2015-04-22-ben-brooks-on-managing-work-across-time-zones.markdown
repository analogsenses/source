I greatly enjoyed this essay by Ben Brooks on how they manage their work across multiple time zones at Martian Craft:

> Once you have an idea who is in what time zone, and what everyone’s core hours are, it’s time to address the biggest problem in a multi-time zone office: _talking_ about time. There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t think: Slack why can’t you translate this time based on who is viewing it.

> Instead, like many people, I bet you find yourself in this trap: “Is that my time, or your time?” That’s easily a 10 minute conversation to get everyone back on the same page. Even then, there is no guarantee that everyone knows exactly when something is supposed to take place.

When there are lots of moving parts, having a well-defined system in place becomes essential.
