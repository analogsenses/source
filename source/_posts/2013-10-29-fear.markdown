[Fear | Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/2013/10/27/fear/)

Matt Gemmell takes a huge load off the chest. I won't spoil it, because such an intimate, personal story deserves your full attention. Just a tidbit:



<blockquote>I had some panic attacks too, during the height of it all. If you’ve had one – a real, proper, actual fireworks-show of a panic attack – then, well… you know. That’s _got_ to be what dying feels like.</blockquote>



Much respect, Matt. Thank you so much for sharing it with us.
