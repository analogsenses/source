Brian Heater, Laughing Squid:

> Relonch is a forthcoming case for the iPhone 5/5s and 6 that brings “magazine-class” photography to the smartphones. The hardware includes a large lens, a shutter button, and a Lightning connector for charging the phone while in use. The company has also created an app for shooting and instantly sharing photos via social networks. Relonch is currently taking pre-orders and expects to begin delivery in late 2015.
