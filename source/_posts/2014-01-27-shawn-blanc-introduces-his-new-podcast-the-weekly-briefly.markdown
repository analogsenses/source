[Shawn Blanc introduces his new podcast, The Weekly Briefly](http://shawnblanc.net/2014/01/the-weekly-briefly-indie-life/)

From my review on iTunes (which, by the way, is something you should always do for the shows you like):



<blockquote>This show is amazing. It's great that Shawn is putting this out there for all people to listen to. This is a weekly, freely available episode of his members-exclusive podcast, "Shawn Today", which is chock-full of great advice for geeks, indies and technology enthusiasts in general, but also eminently enjoyable for the public at large. If you enjoy The Weekly Briefly (and I'm sure you will), you should consider [becoming a member](http://shawnblanc.net/members/) on his site and supporting Shawn's work: outstanding stuff from an awesome human being on a daily basis. What more is there to ask for?</blockquote>



Easiest 5-star rating I've given in a pretty long time.
