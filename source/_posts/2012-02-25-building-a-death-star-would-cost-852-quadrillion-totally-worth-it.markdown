<blockquote>How could something that expensive possibly pay for itself?” we hear you ask. EASILY, that’s how, imaginary question-asker. Once you’ve built yourself a Death Star, you travel around the galaxy and point your $852 quadrillion megalaser at other people’s planets. You’ll be surprised how quickly and COMPLETELY OF THEIR OWN FREE WILL they offer to help cover your costs.</blockquote>



This totally made my day. So awesome, in all its nerd glory.

See also why building your own Death Star is not only totally worth it, but also [quite affordable when you think about it](http://motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/02/death-star-surprisingly-cost-effective-weapons-system). Now, What are we waiting for?
