El Rastro is Madrid’s traditional flea market, a place where there’s literally nothing that’s not for sale. Last Sunday I brought the camera with me and tried to capture some of its unique essence:

> With almost 300 years of history — early mentions of it date back to 1740 — El Rastro is probably the oldest flea market in all of Spain. Loved and visited by locals and tourists alike, El Rastro is as much an experience as it is a market. Everything has a price here, even a few things that really, _really_ shouldn’t.

I really love El Rastro. If you’re ever stopping by Madrid, I can’t recommend visiting enough. You may not end up buying anything, but you’ll definitely go home with a couple interesting stories to tell, at the very least.
