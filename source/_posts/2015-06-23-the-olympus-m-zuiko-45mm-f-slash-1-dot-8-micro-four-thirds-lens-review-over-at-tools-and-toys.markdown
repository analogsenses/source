I’ve been working on this lens review for a while, and I’m super happy with how it turned out. The Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens is one of my favorite pieces of gear and, in my opinion, one of the best values available for any camera system.

This was also my third time working with a professional model, and the first time with a couple. Sara and Álvaro were amazing to work with and I can’t say enough nice things about them. And as usual, this was also a _very_ formative experience. There were plenty of lessons learned along the way and we had lots of fun doing the shoot. Hopefully the end result reflects that, but also hopefully it’s good work that will stand on its own. 

Head on over to _Tools & Toys_ to check it out.
