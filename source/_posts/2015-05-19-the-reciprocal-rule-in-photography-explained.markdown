Great, informative article by Nasim Mansurov over at _Photography Life_:

> Due to the fact that we as humans cannot be completely still, particularly when hand-holding an object like a camera, the movements caused by our bodies can cause camera shake and introduce blur to images. The basic premise of the reciprocal rule is that _the shutter speed of your camera should be at least the reciprocal of the effective focal length of the lens._ If you are confused by what this means, don’t worry – it is really easy to understand once you see it in an example.

Really useful and practical advice. I found the Auto ISO section to be particularly interesting, as I  had always wondered how the optimum ISO was determined when using this feature.
