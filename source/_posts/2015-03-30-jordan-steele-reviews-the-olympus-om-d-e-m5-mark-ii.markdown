Jordan Steele:

> The Olympus OM-D E-M5 Mark II is a very worthy successor to the original ground-breaking E-M5.  Olympus has improved a great many things on the camera, including the direct controls, the viewfinder, the rear screen, the autofocus, the image stabilizer and more, while adding very interesting and useful new features such as Wi-Fi or the most-talked about feature, the High Resolution mode. This mode really does break new ground, allowing for 40 (JPEG) or 64 (RAW) Megapixel images for static scenes. It’s most definitely not a gimmick feature, and with a static scene and a solid tripod, will yield truly high-resolution images with good glass.

I really enjoy Jordan’s reviews, but they're usually terrible for my wallet.
