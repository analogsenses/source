This week on the show we had our first ever guest: Mr. [Dan Hawk](http://danhawk.com).

Among other things, we go over a very interesting article by Drew Coffman, we chat about the basic elements of photography and getting to know your way around a camera, and then we take on the whole digital imitating film trend in recent cameras. After that, there’s a bit of friendly banter about camera bags and my own review of the leather Brixton, and then we all drool over Dan’s RX1R for a while.

Nothing to fear, really, unless you’re currently going through a bout of [GAS](https://www.slrlounge.com/the-cure-for-gear-acquisition-syndrome/). If that’s the case, stay away from this one. You’ve been warned.
