[Apple, Google and the Failure of Open | Apple Insider](http://appleinsider.com/articles/13/07/06/editorial-apple-google-and-the-failure-of-open)



<blockquote>Open Source enthusiasts love to tell you Android is winning, and that it is winning because it is open. But they're wrong on both counts. The history of computing makes that abundantly clear, as do the current leaders in profitability.
</blockquote>



This is a great article. For example:



<blockquote>So rather than "open" being a binary condition that makes companies who claim adherence to it successful at the expense of those who are "closed" and proprietary, the reality is that successful companies can adopt open software in areas that make sense, but they will derive most of their profits from proprietary activity.

And when you look at the world realistically, Google is making its money through proprietary activity in placing ads in front of audiences, just as Apple and Samsung make their money by layering proprietary hardware and software technologies over an increasingly less significant open source core.</blockquote>



Absolutely spot-on.
