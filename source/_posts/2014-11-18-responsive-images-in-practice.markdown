Eric Portis, on how to properly optimize the use of different image resolutions across varying display sizes on the web:

> [Sixty-two percent of the weight of the web is images](http://httparchive.org/interesting.php#bytesperpage), and weâ€™re [serving more image bytes every day](http://httparchive.org/trends.php?s=All&minlabel=Nov+15+2010&maxlabel=Oct+15+2014#bytesImg&reqImg). That would be peachy if all of those bytes were being put to good use. But on small or low-resolution screens, [most of that data is waste](http://timkadlec.com/2013/06/why-we-need-responsive-images/).

Much to digest here, set aside some time to really dive into it.
