Another gem that I missed last week, this time by John Carey:

<blockquote>Photography is a privilege we are lucky to have, but it should never get in the way of our happiness, it should pull us toward it like a magnetic force. The secret to great photography has nothing to do with your philosophy, your choice of format, or your pedigree. Let your camera be your compass. Live first, then shoot.</blockquote>

So much to love in this piece.
