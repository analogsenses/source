Massive news over at starwars.com:

> The screenplay is written by Lawrence Kasdan and Jon Kasdan. The story focuses on how young Han Solo became the smuggler, thief, and scoundrel whom Luke Skywalker and Obi-Wan Kenobi first encountered in the cantina at Mos Eisley.

No word on casting yet, though. I just hope they know what theyâ€™re doing. Via [Kottke](http://kottke.org/15/07/young-han-solo-movie-announced).
