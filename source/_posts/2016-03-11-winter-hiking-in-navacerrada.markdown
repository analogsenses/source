Last Sunday I went hiking in Navacerrada, one of the tallest mountain passes in central Spain. It’s a gorgeous place, covered by pine forests as far as the eye can see, and it’s perfect for hiking, even in the winter.

This photo essay on _Tools & Toys_ tells the story of how the day went, along with some nice landscape shots. It was a fantastic experience, and one I can’t recommend enough.
