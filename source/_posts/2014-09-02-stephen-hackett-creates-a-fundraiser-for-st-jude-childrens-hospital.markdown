September is Childhood Cancer Awareness Month. From [his article](http://www.512pixels.net/blog/2014/9/september-is-childhood-cancer-awareness-month) on 512 Pixels: 

<blockquote>
I've set up a St. Jude fundraising page that I will be linking to instead of RSS sponsors for the month of September. My goal is to raise $1,000 for the kids of St. Jude this month It takes $2 million a day to run the hospital and research center, so $1,000 is a drop in the bucket. Let's make it our drop.
</blockquote>

This is an important cause. I've already donated, and [you should too](http://fundraising.stjude.org/site/TR?fr_id=23600&px=2803749&pg=personal).
