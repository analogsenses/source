Jordan’s review is fantastic, as usual. Lots of interesting thoughts on the camera’s small quirks, and lots of incredibly gorgeous pictures. I was really impressed by how well images shot with old Canon FD glass look on the A7R II. In particular, [this picture](http://admiringlight.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/xander_eyes.jpg) of Jordan’s son, taken with the Canon FD 85mm f/1.8 lens, looks amazingly sharp at the point of focus, with the background melting away into a gorgeous bokeh. Really impressive stuff. 

Given that old Canon FD lenses can be easily purchased today for pennies on the dollar, this quality is enough to make you wonder if the investment on modern, Zeiss-branded autofocusing glass — not to mention the manual-focus Loxia lenses — is really worth it.
