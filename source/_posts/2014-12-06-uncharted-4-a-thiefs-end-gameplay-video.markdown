Sony unveiled the first official gameplay demo of [_‘Uncharted 4: A Thief's End’_](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GODZYNA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00GODZYNA&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=H7QLRD7DL3HRZ3QH) during today's PlayStation Experience event. Even in its current unfinished state, the game looks absolutely stunning:

I've always enjoyed adventure games, but during the past decade I missed a lot of them. I took a seven-year hiatus from gaming between 2005 and 2012, during which time I didn't even own a console. When I decided to start gaming again last year I thought about buying [a PlayStation 4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00M37WR90/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00M37WR90&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=U3KMMWX4URZWKBAP) or an [Xbox One](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CMQTVUA/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CMQTVUA&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=UBHDGTZ4Q7B6U3F5), but I figured this was a great opportunity to discover all the great games of the last generation that I had missed.

At that time, both [the PlayStation 3](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00E369SDM/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00E369SDM&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=MLWU2YUAHWIFLRIS) and the [Xbox 360](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00D9EPI38/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00D9EPI38&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=K2A4FU7MK5AFSMO3) were heavily discounted, and most games were easy to find in used condition for just a few bucks. The reason I chose the PS3 over the slightly cheaper Xbox 360 was just so that I could play through the Uncharted games, and I'm _so_ gad I did. After finishing them all, I can confidently say Uncharted may be my favorite video game series of all time.

Judging from what I just saw on this video, it looks like Nathan Drake's next adventure will be his best ever, and I can hardly wait to get my hands on it. I may have to seriously reconsider my decision to not buy the PS4 when this game comes out.
