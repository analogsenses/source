What an awesome way to introduce an app:

Kidding aside, Manual is a very interesting app that lets you control all parameters of exposure when shooting with the iPhone's camera.[^Manual1] If you want to have more control over the pictures you take, this is a great way to do it.

[^Manual1]: Well, all except aperture, because the iPhone's camera lens is a fixed aperture design.
