Doug Bierend:

> Iranian photographer Mohammad Reza Domiri gives us an opportunity to see the entirety of these incredible spaces all at once. His fully panoramic, expansive photographs of centuries-old mosques reveal the genius of their geometries and complexity. The effect is dizzying in a different way, like some kind of fractalized religious hallucination.

There are some jaw-droppingly beautiful images in here. 

Also, you may want to check out [this Flickr search](https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=mezquita%20córdoba) with many more equally-amazing pictures of the [Mosque-cathedral of Córdoba](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosque–Cathedral_of_Córdoba), Spain, an Islamic mosque from the Middle Ages that was later converted into a Catholic Christian church, but still keeps most of its Moorish heritage intact:
