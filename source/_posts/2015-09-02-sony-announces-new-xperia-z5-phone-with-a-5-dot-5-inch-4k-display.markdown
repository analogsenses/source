From Jonathan Bray’s hands-on review:

> Think about that for a minute. That’s 2,160 x 3,840 pixels crammed into a space not much larger than a four-fingered KitKat. It delivers a ridiculously high pixel density of 806ppi and, needless to say, delivers images that are pinprick sharp. For the first time in a long time, Sony can boast that it’s ahead of the smartphone game.

> Do you need it, though? Lord no. I’d hazard a guess that even the Bionic Man would struggle to tell the difference between this and even an iPhone 6 Plus, which  “only” has a 1080p screen and the same screen dimensions. Even if you could spy all the details, the question of content rears its ugly head: there still isn’t that much available to make a 4K screen on a TV, let alone a smartphone, a compelling reason for purchase.
