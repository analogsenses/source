My review of the stunning [Sony Zeiss Distagon T\* FE 35mm f/1.4 ZA](http://amznlinks.com/global?user=analogsenses&us=B00U29GNBO&uk=B00UJRSOB6&es=B00UJRSOB6) lens was published today on _Tools & Toys_.

This review is a special one for me. I’d been after this lens since it was announced a few years ago, and ever since I finally got it this summer I’ve been fighting the urge to write my hot take on it.

It would have been fun, but this time I felt like I needed to use the lens for a good, long while before putting my thoughts out there. Rushing to judgement is never a good idea, and I really didn’t want to spoil this one because I had a feeling it was going to be one of my all-time favorite lenses.

Now, after six months or so I finally feel prepared to review this lens, and I’m happy to say my take on it remains as enthusiastic as it was on day one. The Sony Zeiss 35mm f/1.4 is an absolute stunner of a lens, and I’m so glad I bit the bullet and bought it despite the steep $1,600 price.

This is also a special review because it’s a pretty obvious love letter to Madrid — more so than any of my previous reviews. I’ve never been shy about telling people just how great a city Madrid is, but this is one of the first times when I feel like I’m actually able to show them. And it feels _great_.

If you have some time, grab yourself a nice beverage and head on over to _Tools & Toys_ for [the full review](http://toolsandtoys.net/reviews/the-sony-zeiss-distagon-t-fe-35mm-f1-4-za-lens-review/).
