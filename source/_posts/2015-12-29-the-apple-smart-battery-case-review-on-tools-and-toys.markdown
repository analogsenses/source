My review of the Apple Smart Battery Case was published today on _Tools & Toys_. Long story short, I was surprised by how good the case is, despite the unsightly hump.

Alas, my brand-new iPhone 6s has more than enough battery life for my current usage, so I won’t be keeping the Smart Battery Case. If I were in the market for a battery case, though, I would probably go with this one.

By the way, while I was thinking about the review, I recorded a small video trying to show how to put the iPhone in and out of the case. It somehow ended up turning into a mini-review of sorts, and I’m actually quite happy with how it turned out. Check it out:
