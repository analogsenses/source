“Alcohol Chemistry” is an awesome series of articles and accompanying infographics over at Compound Interest:

> Gin is a spirit that we’ve been making for centuries; although Franciscus Sylvius, a Dutch physician and scientist, is often credited with its discovery in the 17th century, references to gin (or genever as it was also known) exist as far back as the 13th century. Sylvius originally conceived it as an concoction for the treatment of kidney and bladder problems, but its popularity as a recreational drink later soared.

Obligatory posting. And whatever you do, don’t miss [The Chemistry of Whisky](http://www.compoundchem.com/2015/03/31/whisky/). I feel smarter already.
