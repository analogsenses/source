Juli Clover, over at _MacRumors_:

> Disney Story Artist Jeff Ranjo [shared a Periscope](https://twitter.com/JeffRanjo/status/651452347814535168) that demonstrates the iPad Pro in action, and several images of the Disney team’s drawings were shared on Twitter. The Disney team was using a beta version of popular drawing app _Procreate_, which has been updated to work with the iPad Pro, and an iPad Pro version of _Paper by Fiftythree_ was also shown off.

That was cool to watch, but I’m not sure how representative it is of the iPad Pro’s capabilities in the hands of regular humans. I mean, those guys are so incredibly talented I’m sure they could draw just as well with something as crude as a piece of paper and a simple pencil.
