At least this one looks like it’s got some meat in it, though admittedly it won’t take much to erase 2013’s terrible _[Jobs](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357129/)_ movie from our memories. 

Physical similarity is an important factor when casting actors in biopics, but even though Ashton Kutcher looked a lot like a young Steve Jobs, I’ll take Fassbender over him any day of the week.
