My review of the [Manfrotto 209 + 492 Long](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VD8380/?tag=analogsens-20) tabletop tripod kit was published today on _Tools & Toys_. I’ve owned this little tripod for a few months, and I’m super impressed with it. It’s so tiny that I always have it in my bag, it’s actually useful, and it’s made to last.

As a side note, I made a quick time-lapse video to show what you can do with this little thing:
