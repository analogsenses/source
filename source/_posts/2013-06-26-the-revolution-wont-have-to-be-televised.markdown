[The Revolution Won’t Have To Be Televised | Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com/2013/06/26/the-revolution-wont-have-to-be-televised/)



<blockquote>The old guard has not learned that yet. They still believe in a world where, if they don’t cover it, no one will find out. That the truth only exists the way they wish to tell it, when they wish to tell it, if they wish to tell the truth at all.

We on the ground know that time is long since past. That we don’t need them to televise revolutions and that there is no such thing as a local story. We know that history is best told by those who are living it and we have the tools to hear directly from the source.</blockquote>



Just go read the whole thing. Trust me.
