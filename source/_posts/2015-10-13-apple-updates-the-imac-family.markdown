Apple today updated the entire iMac lineup, launching [a new 21.5-inch model](http://www.apple.com/imac/) with a 4K Retina display and extending the 5K Retina display to all of the 27-inch models. From the official press release:

> Apple® today updated the entire iMac® family, bringing a stunning new Retina® 4K display to the 21.5-inch iMac for the first time and the Retina 5K display to every 27-inch iMac. The new Retina displays make photos and videos more immersive and true-to-life thanks to a wider color gamut and spectacular image quality. The updated iMacs also feature more powerful processors and graphics, two Thunderbolt® 2 ports and new storage options that make the high-performance Fusion Drive even more affordable.

So far this update seems like a typical yearly upgrade. But wait, there’s more:

> Apple today also introduced a new lineup of wireless accessories including the all-new Magic Keyboard™, Magic Mouse® 2 and Magic Trackpad® 2. The Magic devices have been redesigned to feel more comfortable than ever, and feature rechargeable batteries that completely eliminate the need for disposable batteries. The new Magic Trackpad 2 also brings Apple’s revolutionary Force Touch interface to the desktop, adding a new dimension to the iMac experience.

At first glance, those new accessories look uglier than the ones they’re replacing, with the sole exception of the Magic Mouse, which remains nearly identical. That said, I’m still curious to try them. Force Touch is an interesting feature, and Apple seems to be betting big on it for the future. 

Another great feature is the built-in rechargeable battery that all three accessories have. I never remember to keep spare batteries around, so this is definitely a welcome addition for me.
