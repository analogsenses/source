Michelle Buchman, writing for nerdist.com:

> Keepers and trainers at aquariums and zoos all over are announcing their membership in Pratt’s raptor squad. Starting on Tumblr, keepers have been posting photos recreating the famous shot of Pratt’s character Owen Grady taming the velociraptors. I love a good meme, and these photos are amazing. What better way to spread the word about zoos and aquariums?

Things like this will make the Internet a net gain for humanity long after the machines have risen against us.
