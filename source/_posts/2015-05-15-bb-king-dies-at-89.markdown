Beautiful obituary by Tony Russell over at _The Guardian_:

> [BB King](http://www.theguardian.com/music/bb-king), who has died aged 89, was the most influential blues musician of his generation and the musicâ€™s most potent symbol. He represented the blues as Louis Armstrong once represented jazz, a single performer who could nevertheless stand, and speak, for the whole genre.

So sad.
