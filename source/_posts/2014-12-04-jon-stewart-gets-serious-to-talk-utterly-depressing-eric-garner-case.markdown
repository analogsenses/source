Jon Stewart, on The Daily Show:

> I honestly don't know what to say. If comedy is tragedy plus time, I need more fucking time. But I would really settle for less fucking tragedy, to be honest with you.

I've avoided posting anything related to this topic because, not living in the US, I wasn't entirely sure I could be objective. This case, however, is just too much to stay silent.

Again, I've embedded a YouTube clip of the segment in this article, but if the video is removed — it happens sometimes — the title link will take you to Comedy Central's official website, where you can watch it on their Flash-based player. Sorry about that.
