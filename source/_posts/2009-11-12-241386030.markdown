It’s funny how in the top-class watch market, analog watches are undoubtely the norm. We are talking about pretty expensive gadgets here, and digital models are virtually non-existent in the catalogs of the first brands.

Analog watches have a more classic appeal, in my opinion, just look at this Bvlgari. After seeing this, why in the world would you want to buy a digital watch?

Don’t get me wrong, I’m all for the digital world… when it makes sense, when it’s necessary, and when it’s adequate. But not on a default basis. Digital doesn’t always mean better, as you can see.
