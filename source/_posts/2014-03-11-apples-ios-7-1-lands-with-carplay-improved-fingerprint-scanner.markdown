[Apples iOS 7.1 lands with CarPlay, improved fingerprint scanner | CNET News](http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-57620109-37/apples-ios-7.1-lands-with-carplay-improved-fingerprint-scanner/)



<blockquote>Apple on Monday released an update to its iOS 7 mobile operating system -- iOS 7.1 -- that adds new features such as CarPlay and fixes bugs.

With iOS 7.1, Apple also tweaked its Siri voice assistant, iTunes Radio, and its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The company streamlined the operating system to make it work better with the iPhone 4, made some user interface refinements, and included some stability and accessibility improvements.</blockquote>



Nice update overall. The fingerprint scanner really could use some tweaking. I also find it impressive that Apple continues to optimize iOS 7 to work on the oldest iPhone model that supports it, the iPhone 4.
