[What should the speed limit be for cars in cities? | TreeHugger]()

A simple and intuitive way to understand why lowering the speed limit in our cities is a must:

[![Speed Limit - Copenhagenize](https://v4s.yimg.com/so/7382/12674225023_6235bbd883.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/12674225023/)



<blockquote>20 MPH/30 KPH seems to be a good compromise, with the number of deaths being very small and the number of uninjured victims being more significant, unlike with higher speeds where things are reversed. Though of course a low speed limit should be the last thing we count on to save lives; cities should be designed for walking, and the infrastructure should be designed to make things safe for everybody, including pedestrians.</blockquote>



We need to take our cities back.
