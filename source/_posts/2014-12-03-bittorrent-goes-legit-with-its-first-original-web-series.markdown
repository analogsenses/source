Michelle Castillo, Adweek:

> Next fall, BitTorrent will distribute its first original Web series, [Children of the Machine](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3882138/). The series is helmed by Marco Weber (producer of Igby Goes Down and The Thirteenth Floor) and takes place in the year 2031, in a futuristic society where androids take over and force humans to band together to survive. And, if you're interested, the only place to get it is to download it via a BitTorrent Bundle, a service that allows artists to release content directly to consumers. 

> “This is a science fiction show catered to the typical tech-savvy, male-dominated audience,” Weber said. “We're not trying to launch a romantic comedy, so the concept of this show moved us toward BitTorrent.”

Translation: “Robots, guns, and boobs”. Robots with boobs?

Also:

> The pilot and an ad-supported version of Children of the Machine will be made available for free download, but those who want to skip ads can pay $4.95 for the eight-episode season or $9.95 for bonus content.

Good luck with that.
