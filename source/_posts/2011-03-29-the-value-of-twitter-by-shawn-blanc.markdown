<blockquote>Twitter is not trying to answer the question of who would or would not stay and pay. They are trying to find a business model that will support those who cannot pay so even more of them will sign up.</blockquote>


That's it in a nut. Shawn's take on the recent changes that are shaking up Twitter is, as usual, spot on. Just further proof that if you haven't [signed up for a membership yet](http://shawnblanc.net/members/), you're really doing yourself a disservice.
