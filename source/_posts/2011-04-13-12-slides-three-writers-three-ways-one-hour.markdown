[12 Slides, Three Writers, Three Ways -- One Hour | SXSW.com](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP7472)

Jim Coudal, Michael Lopp and John Gruber speaking at SXSW 2011 about their different approaches to writing:


<blockquote>In this presentation, you will see the same set of 15 slides -- three times. Three different writers will walk through the same set of slides and explain their approaches to getting started, editing ideas, figuring out how to get unstuck, and understanding when they're done. Part improv and part preparation, this presentation will give you three totally different and unexpected perspectives regarding the art of writing.</blockquote>


Fantastic talk, packed with great advice. The only thing I cannot understand is how on Earth, having those three monsters on stage, there was only ONE question from the audience. I would have kept them there for hours if I had the chance.
