The final episode of ‘The Colbert Report’ airs tonight:

> For nine years, [Stephen Colbert](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/stephen_colbert/index.html?inline=nyt-per) has relentlessly maintained his pompous, deeply ridiculous but consistently appealing conservative blowhard character on his late-night show, “The Colbert Report” — so much so that when he puts the character to rest for good on Thursday night, he may have to resort to comicide. The Grim Reaper is his last guest.

It's sad to see such a great show end, but I'm really looking forward to see what Colbert — the real Colbert — does with ‘The Late Show’.
