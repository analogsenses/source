Great commercial by Franck Matellini for British Airways:

> Paris & NY, like many large cities, have a lot in common; transport, infrastructure, national monuments. I wanted to explore not only these comparisons but also the differences, in order to expose the beauty and individuality of each. What you cannot deny is the vibrancy and explosion of character each city has and I thought split-screen with timelapse would be a good way to help convey this.
