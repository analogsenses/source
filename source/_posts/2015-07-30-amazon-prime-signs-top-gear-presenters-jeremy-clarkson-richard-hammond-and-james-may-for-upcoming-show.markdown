James Vincent, reporting for _The Verge_:

> Former Top Gear presenters Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond, and James May have signed [up for a new motoring show on Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=7124555031), set to air in 2016. The news ends months of speculation about the trio's future on TV after the BBC refused to renew Clarkson's contract following a “fracas” during filming this year. The deal is a major coup for Amazon's streaming service, which lags behind rival Netflix, and although there are no details of how much the firm paid for the trio, a company insider [told the _London Evening Standard_](http://www.standard.co.uk/news/celebritynews/amazon-sign-top-gears-jeremy-clarkson-richard-hammond-and-james-may-for-new-show-10426102.html): “We have made a significant investment.”

I must say, I didn’t see this coming. A few years ago, I used to watch _Top Gear_ every morning while having breakfast, but I kind of fell out of love with it some time ago, and the whole situation with Clarkson didn’t help. Still, I’ll be watching the first few episodes of their new show, because the potential for greatness is definitely there.
