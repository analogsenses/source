The review embargo for Apple Watch was lifted today, meaning the entire Internet is buzzing with tons of brand new Apple Watch reviews. 

Even though we all new this was coming, I’m still genuinely surprised by the sheer volume of work that’s been published about such a small device. All in all, we’re talking about many tens of thousands of words to read, which to be honest is pretty intimidating. Luckily, Raymond Wong of Mashable has compiled [this handy chart](http://mashable.com/2015/04/08/apple-watch-meta-review/) for your convenience.
