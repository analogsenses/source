Some really wonderful cover designs on this month’s selections by The Casual Optimist. I love the ones that are apparently simpler. “Simple” here is of course a terribly misleading word to use, because minimalism in design is hard: it often takes a _lot_ more work to make a simple design that looks good instead of a more complicated one.
