Good news from the official Google AdWords Google+ account (sigh):

> In June, we announced (https://goo.gl/TF7dmD) that Chrome will begin pausing many Flash ads by default to improve performance for users. This change is scheduled to start rolling out on September 1, 2015. 

> Most Flash ads uploaded to AdWords are automatically converted to HTML5.

They also offer [a converter](https://goo.gl/ZBq5DR) for those ads that can't be automatically rendered in HTML5. This should nicely improve loading performance for many big sites.
