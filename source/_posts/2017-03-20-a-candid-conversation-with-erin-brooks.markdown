Erin Brooks, iPhoneographer extraordinaire, joins us for a far-reaching chat about modern photography. Along the way, we find out about her involvement in the Shot on iPhone campaign for Apple, her favorite apps for editing, and where a standard mirrorless camera fits into her workflow.

Erin is such an awesome guest. Trust me, youâ€™re not going to want to miss this one.
