Mikael Colville-Andersen describes the Cycling Test that kids need to pass in many Danish schools:

> The test has been around since 1947. It’s not mandatory but many schools choose to do it. When kids are in the 1st grade they get a week of initial cyclist “how-to” regarding rules of the road, etc. Then, in 6th grade, they rock the test like today. In my opinion, the test is great but it’s also rather symbolic. Most of these kids have been cycling in the city since they were little. Felix has rocked the cycle tracks since he was three and a half. Parents teach them the rules and, most important, give them the practice they need. By the time they get to the 6th grade, the majority have a great deal of on-asphalt experience on their bicycles. Our school chooses to make passing the test a pre-requisite for going on outings by bike when they get older.

It’s such a different story around these parts. I’d love to see my future kids grow up in a bicycle-friendly environment like Copenhagen. But even Copenhagen isn’t perfect:

> You can, however, see how the Culture of Fear has influenced things even here in Denmark. In the emails leading up to the day it was stated that helmets had to be worn. I informed the teacher responsible that Felix doesn’t wear a helmet and a longer discussion ensued. It’s clear that the Danish Road Safety Council have influenced a lot of people with their wacko ideology. I was informed that the school’s traffic policy requires helmets. I looked it up - it doesn’t. They merely “urge” students to wear them. I was told he could borrow a helmet. I asked if they were washed and disinfected. They weren’t. 

> Then I was told it wasn’t up to the school but that I would have to talk to the Danish Road Safety Council or the police. I responded that the Road Safety Council is just an NGO and has no power and the police merely refer to the Danish traffic law which doesn’t require helmets. At the end of the day I was told I could sign a form exempting Felix from wearing a helmet. Fine. Except there is no form and Felix just did as he pleased.

The helmet debate is one of the most annoying, time-consuming “issues” in modern urban cycling, and it's still far from being resolved.
