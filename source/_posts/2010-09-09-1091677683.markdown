Introducing, for the first time, [my personal website](http://alvaroserrano.com/) for those of you who understand Spanish (it is, after all, my first language).




The purpose of this web is two-fold:




First, it will enable me to learn how to code and build a website, which I've always wanted to do. But I'm starting one small step at a time. At the moment the web is handled by Wordpress, while it's up to me to figure out how to tweak the theme and learn basic CSS. Who knows, maybe I'll build a new one from the ground up one day. Suggestions, by the way, are not only welcome, but encouraged ;)




Second, I feel more comfortable writing about certain things in Spanish. Things that wouldn't fit very well with Tumblr, or the tone I'm trying to set for this blog. But don't worry, **Analog Senses** is very much alive, and it will continue to see the same kind of content that before. Only bigger, better, and uncut (and more frequently updated, I hope!)




That said, I give you [alvaroserrano.com](http://alvaroserrano.com). I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I do publishing it.





Cheers,





√Ålvaro.
