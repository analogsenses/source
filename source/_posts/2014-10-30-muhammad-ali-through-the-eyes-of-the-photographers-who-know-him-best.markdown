Jonny Weeks, The Guardian:

> Ali’s iconic status – and he is surely a man befitting of that word, iconic – is inextricably married to the photographs that exist of him. While his poetic tongue and rapid wit charmed us, and his poise and ruthlessness in the ring thrilled us, the imagery of him toned our appreciation of his personality, craft and beauty. Photographs are now among the defining symbols by which we remember him.

Great pictures tell stories, and there are very few stories as fascinating as Ali's.
