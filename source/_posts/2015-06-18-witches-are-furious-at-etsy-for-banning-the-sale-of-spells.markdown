Jaya Saxena, writing at _The Daily Dot_:

> But many who sell supernatural goods on the site are claiming Etsy has been on something of a witch hunt (sorry), changing its rules about the sale of metaphysical services and shutting down stores without warning.

> “Swathes of us have now had our sales and shop views tank, and there is great distress in the metaphysical community,” one vendor, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Daily Dot in an email. 

Can’t they, I don’t know, make an anti-banning spell? That ought to take care of everything.
