Marco Arment plays “[What if?](http://what-if.xkcd.com)” with Apple’s device lineup. What if Apple made some different design choices to create alternate versions of some of its products with actual all-day battery life?

> Design is about making difficult decisions and trade-offs. Longer battery lives would make some of the products thicker and heavier, and not everyone would accept that trade-off. But today, everyone who wants an Apple product needs to accept the opposite: thinness and lightness that some of us didn’t need, at the expense of battery life that many of us could’ve really used.

He does have a point. I’d buy some of the devices he cites as examples in a heartbeat.
