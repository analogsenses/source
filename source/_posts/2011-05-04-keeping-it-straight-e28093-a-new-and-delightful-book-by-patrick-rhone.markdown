How would you describe a book that contains a lifetime's worth of keen insight into the human soul? Words inevitably fall short, unable to do justice to the passion and dedication behind this wonderful piece of literature. Through his gentle, thoughtful writing, we get to know Patrick the writer, but we also get a glimpse of Patrick the human being. He may not have all the answers, but that's not what he is after. Patrick's journey is one of calm and collected self-discovery, the kind of journey that you want to last forever. With this book, we get a personal invitation to join him for the ride.

And that's an offer you just can't refuse.
