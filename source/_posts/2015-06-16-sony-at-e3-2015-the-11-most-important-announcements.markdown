Adi Robertson covers Sony’s announcements in yesterday’s E3 keynote for _The Verge_. There are plenty of awesome games coming, most notably among which are _The Last Guardian_, _Uncharted 4_, _Shenmue 3_ and the long, long awaited remake of _Final Fantasy VII_, which is one of my all-time personal top-2 games:

It appears Sony is throwing the kitchen sink at the PS4, and I couldn’t be happier. I suppose one could argue that these are all well-established franchises and that the lack of some high-profile new and original releases is somewhat worrying. Then again, any chance I can get to kick Sephiroth’s treacherous ass all over again is fine by me.

There are still a few months to go before any of these titles are available, and some of them won’t show up for well over a year but if they live up to their names, it’ll be well worth the wait.
