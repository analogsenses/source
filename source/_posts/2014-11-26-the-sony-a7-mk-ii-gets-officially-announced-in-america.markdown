Chris Gampat, The Phoblographer:

> Earlier on this week, Sony announced the [A7 Mk II in Japan](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/11/20/new-sony-a7-mk-ii-features-5-axis-stabilization/). But today, they’re finally announcing it here in the US. The camera is the world’s first full frame mirrorless camera with image stabilization built into the sensor. It uses a five axis stabilization system they Sony claims is not the same that Olympus has despite the partnership between the two companies. The company also claims around 4.5 stops of stabilization from the new image stabilized sensor. It will work with all of the lenses that Sony has created as well as third party options, though they state that some lenses aren’t compatible.

Whoa. 5-Axis in-body image stabilization in a full-frame mirrorless camera that is compatible with Leica M lenses. The whole package.
