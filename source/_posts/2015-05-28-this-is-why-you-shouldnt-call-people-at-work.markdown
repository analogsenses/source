Sofia Quintero:

> An unexpected phone call can be a huge distraction, especially if it happens at the wrong time. The act of recovering from an interruption can cost you a big part of your working day. In fact, most of us lose 28 percent (or 2.1 hours a day) of our productivity to constant interruptions and [recovery time](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html).

> When people call me out of the blue it feels to me like they are saying in their most macabre voice: “_I own your time now, my life and my priorities are more important than yours so now proceed and surrender to my communications needs._”

> This is especially uncomfortable when we are talking about sales calls. In that case is more like this: “_Hello, let me interrupt your day now because I really want to sell you something and I am sure you have nothing better to do with your time than talking to me._”

Agreed. This is exactly right and it really, _really_ pisses me off. In my eyes, there’s nothing more disrespectful towards your customers than invading their personal space like this.

The good news is, we can fight back. A couple years ago I left my bank after more than a decade with them because they wouldn’t stop calling me during office hours. And more recently I switched Internet providers simply because they wouldn’t stop trying to upsell me to a “better” plan, despite me having told then repeatedly that I wasn’t interested.

Was it a pain to switch? Absolutely. Was it worth it? Hell, yes.
