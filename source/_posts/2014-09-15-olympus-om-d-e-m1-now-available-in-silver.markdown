Damn. That is a fine-looking camera. The only thing I didn't love about the E-M1 was the fact that it didn't come in silver, and now it finally does. 

The E-M1 is way more camera than I need, but if I were in the market for a top-shelf mirrorless camera, this one would certainly top my list of candidates.
