Interesting concept: 

> Designers Juan José Monsalve, Andrés Roi, and Cristóbal Cabello say on their Yerka Project website that their prototype bike "looks like a traditional bike to the naked eye, but it’s the safest bicycle you’ll find" because "we decided to make a lock out of the frame" so "the only way to steal it is to break the lock, which implies breaking the bike."

Be sure to check out the video at [the project's website](http://nadiemelaroba.cl) to get a better idea of how it works.
