Myke Hurley:

> In the first episode of “Behind the App”, a special series of Inquisitive, we take a look at the beginnings of iOS app development, by focusing on the introduction of the iPhone and the App Store.

Interesting new series, and the production values are the best I’ve seen in a good, long while. Absolutely recommended.
