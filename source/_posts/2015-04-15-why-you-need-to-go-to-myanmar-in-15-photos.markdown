Nic McCormack:

> Myanmar is a global traveler’s dream. Many years under a military dictatorship kept this southeast Asian country—known previously as Burma—a virtual time capsule that’s just emerging. Emerald landscapes, spellbinding Buddhist temples, powdery beaches, and a youth-driven city scene drew three million visitors in 2014, a number that’s expected to swell to five million this year. Will you be one of them?

Stunning images.
