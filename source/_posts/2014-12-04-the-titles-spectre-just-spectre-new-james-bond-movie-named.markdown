Ben Child, The Guardian:

> The 24th Bond movie will be titled Spectre after the evil global terrorist organisation first introduced by Ian Fleming in the 1961 novel Thunderball, it was revealed today.

> At a live-streamed press conference from Pinewood Studios, producers also confirmed previous reports that the new film will feature Christoph Waltz and LÃ©a Seydoux among the supporting cast.

Exciting. 

Also, check out [the new Aston Martin DB10](http://www.theverge.com/2014/12/4/7331787/james-bond-spectre-aston-martin-db10), which was built [specifically for the movie](http://www.astonmartin.com/en/live/news/2014/12/04/built-for-bond-aston-martin-debuts-unique-car-for-spectre). Jaw-droppingly gorgeous.
