This is a very special week for Candid. With me being at Photokina, we decided to provide some extended coverage by releasing a new episode every day of the week. Each episode will be dedicated to discussing the announcements from one particular company/camera system, and our goal is to keep them about 30 minutes long.

In the first of our special Photokina episodes, Marius and I chat about my first day at the show and my impressions on the announcements — or lack thereof — from Sony.
