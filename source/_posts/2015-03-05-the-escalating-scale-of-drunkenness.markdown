Ryan D’Agostino, Esquire Magazine:

> **Empirically, there is no better** number of drinks than three. Three drinks shoves you right up to the blurry border between you and drunkenness, a line in the sand that's been washed over by a wave — you can still see it, but barely. It's a thrilling place to be. You're flying, feeling it, maybe spitting out the wrong word every now and then, maybe calling your sister for no reason, but you could still operate a forklift if you really had to. You can still hit the dartboard. One fewer and you're drinking responsibly; one more and you're walking on your knees and suggesting everybody go for karaoke.

Sounds like a solid approach to me. Via [Mark Bylok](https://twitter.com/markbylok/status/573262156914954240).
