The word “work”, as we commonly use it, often carries incredibly negative connotations. When your work doesn’t inspire you, it’s hard to find the silver lining — particularly on a Monday morning. But does it have to be that way? Matt invites us to look for the thing that doesn't _feel_ like work to us:

> When you’re doing _that_ thing, you can’t wait to _get to work_. Evenings are continuations. Weekends are more opportunities to fashion _great works_. Holidays are a change of scenery, without the final day being tinged with sadness and dread, before you return to _your life’s work_.

> Compensation is a welcome bonus, for something you’d be doing regardless. Retirement is unthinkable - why would I ever stop?

Nailed it. There's a great sense of relief in knowing you're doing _exactly_ what you're supposed to be doing. The thing that fits, as Matt wrote. It's intoxicating. Analog Senses is that thing for me, and now I can’t believe it took me so long to figure it out.
