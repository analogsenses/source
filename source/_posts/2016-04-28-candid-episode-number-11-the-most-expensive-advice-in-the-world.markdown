This week’s episode was packed with interesting stuff. First up we answer an excellent listener question about safety when traveling with photography gear. It’s a very important issue and potentially a very expensive problem if your equipment gets stolen during a trip, so we all share the different techniques we use to protect both our pictures and our gear, and minimize the risk of becoming a theft victim.

Then Josh briefly talks about his new MacBook and shares his first impressions of the new [Sony 85mm f/1.4 GM](http://amzn.to/1TysImF) lens, but the conversation quickly flows into a deeper discussion on the ethics of product reviews, trust, and bias. I have some strong feelings on this matter, as I’ve mentioned [here](http://www.analogsenses.com/2016/04/24/morning-coffee/) before, so this was a great opportunity to explore them. 

As product reviewers ourselves, we may have a different perspective on this issue than the general consumer, so hopefully our insights and concerns will help raise awareness of some of the existing problems with honesty in product reviews these days.
