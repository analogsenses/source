Jim Dalrymple, _The Loop_:

> Apple on Wednesday updated its iconic iPods with new colors and a host of new features for the iPod touch.

> Apple went all out with the [iPod touch](http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/), giving the device the A8 chip, the same one used in the iPhone 6. Apple told me yesterday that the CPU in the new touch is six times faster than its predecessor and 10 times faster in graphics performance.

The camera has also been substantially improved. Looks like fans of the long-neglected iPod touch have good reasons to celebrate.
