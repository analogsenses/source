> Nantes and its 600,000 inhabitants - including the immediate suburbs - is one of the French cities that decided to implement an ambitious cycling policy. They dared to innovate and to make strong political decisions. We find that inspiring.

It's great to see there are some cities that understand the importance of a strong bicycle culture, and how it correlates to the well-being of its citizens.

> To begin with, watch the [Velo-City 2015 promotional clip](https://vimeo.com/97097924). In this video, Nantes demonstrates that they understand that creating a bicycle-friendly city is not just about building infrastructure but it's most of all about developing [a life-sized city](http://www.copenhagenize.com/2013/07/lulu-and-life-sized-city.html) where bicycles are merely one of the tools to create an active, creative and liveable city - albeit one of the most important tools. Nantes presents in the video its inhabitants, its urban spaces and its activities

They're definitely setting a strong example. Here's hoping others will follow.
