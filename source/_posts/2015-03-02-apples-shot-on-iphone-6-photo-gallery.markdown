You’ve probably seen this already, especially considering that John Gruber linked to it and even Tim Cook himself [tweeted about it](https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/572424238822395906), but I had to post it anyway. This is an amazing photo gallery of pictures shot exclusively on the new iPhone 6. 

Some of these are so good that it’s hard to believe they came out of a smartphone camera, but the great thing about them is not that they’re _technically_ great pictures, but that they’re _creatively_ amazing as well. 

It’s good to know that the iPhone 6 camera is technically impressive, but no amount of camera gear will ever be able to replace a photographer’s creativity and artistic vision. Apple’s gallery does a fantastic job of telling that story.
