Some of these are hilarious. Kudos to The Economist, for example:

> In a leader last month (Of bongs and bureaucrats, January 11th) we said that The Economist first proposed legalising drugs in 1993. In fact we argued for it in a cover story in 1988. Who says drug use doesnâ€™t damage long-term memory?
