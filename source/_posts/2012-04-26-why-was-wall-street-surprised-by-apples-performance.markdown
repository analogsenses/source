Horace Dediu:


<blockquote>The reason lies in the way the Earth is tilted and the way the continents are arranged upon it. So perhaps a better understanding of astronomy and geography would have helped investors make decisions during the past few weeks. I suggest remedial lessons for those who missed this.</blockquote>



Horace Dediu, being badass. I love it.
