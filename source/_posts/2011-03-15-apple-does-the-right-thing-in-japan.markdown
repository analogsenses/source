[Apple does the right thing in Japan | Kevin Rose](http://kevinrose.com/blogg/2011/3/14/apples-role-in-japan-during-the-tohoku-earthquake.html)


<blockquote>The earthquake hit while I was working on the first floor of one of their stores.  As the entire building swayed, the staff calmly led people from the top 5 floors down to the first floor, and under the ridiculously strong wooden tables that hold up the display computers. 7 hours and 118 aftershocks later, the store was still open.  Why? Because with the phone and train lines down, taxis stopped, and millions of people stuck in the Tokyo shopping district scared, with no access to television, hundreds of people were swarming into Apple stores to watch the news on USTREAM and contact their families via Twitter, Facebook, and email.</blockquote>


Impressive story. People seize every opportunity to criticize Apple and the way it milks their customers' money, but there is so much more to Apple than that. It is a company ran by people, for people; and their culture influences everything they do, not just what they sell:


<blockquote>Because the trains and phones were down, almost everyone who worked in Tokyo was stranded deep in the city.  All the hotels were booked, the roads were jammed, so hundreds of people were instantly homeless.  Apple told all of their staff - Retail AND Corporate - that they could go sleep at the Apple stores.  The Senior managers at the stores had been notified earlier and unbeknownst to us, had gone out to stock up on food and drinks after the very first quake hit.</blockquote>


As Steve himself would say, "It's in Apple's DNA to act like this".
