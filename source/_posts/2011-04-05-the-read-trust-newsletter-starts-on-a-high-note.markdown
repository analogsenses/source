[The Read & Trust newsletter starts on a high note | Read & Trust](http://readandtrust.com)


<blockquote>Read & Trust is committed to gathering together the best independent writers availableâ€”the ones recommended by the writers you read and trust.</blockquote>


Who better to kick start this amazing initiative than [Patrick Rhone](http://patrickrhone.com), one of my favorite authors on the Internet. Actually, one of my favorite authors, period. The first article in the series is nothing short of astounding. It is insightful, first-class writing at its best. Every bit as promised on the box, which is rare these days, and precisely that makes it all the more special.

If it piques your curiosity, go ahead and [sign up](http://readandtrust.com/newsletter.php). For only $5 a month it is a tremendous value. And with the likes of [Marco Arment](http://marco.org), [Shawn Blanc](http://shawnblanc.net), [Ben Brooks](http://brooksreview.net/) and many more, it's only going to get better.

These are not just excellent writers with a deep passion for writing, they're also genuinely generous people, and a great source of inspiration for me. They are whom I look up to when I sit down here and type on this site, in the hopes that one day I will be able to achieve a fraction of what they've already accomplished. I'm grateful to have a chance to support their work in such a great way.

One article done, many more to come.

I can hardly wait.
