Josh Ginter:

> The first characteristic my wife and I were looking for was the ability to take a camera wherever without feeling like we were carrying an anchor around our necks. I purchased a Nikon D5100 and Nikkor 18-200mm travel lens a couple years back and we abhorred having to carry that camera around. Cameras have to be readily available when inspiration strikes and, if your camera is sitting on the shelf in the hotel room, it's not going to do a very good job.

This is a fantastic review. I also own an E-M10 and can't recommend it enough. For a small and light, but high-quality system, the E-M10 is hard to beat.

I only have two comments, regarding how I personally use the camera:

* Unlike Josh, I don't use the accessory grip, and never felt like I was missing out on any extra ergonomics. Then again, I have fairly small hands.

* The supplied neck strap is not particularly great, but I always use it and couldn't imagine not having it. I will probably upgrade to a fancier one soon, but for now I think it's adequate.

A camera is a very personal item, and different people will of course have different preferences. Luckily, the E-M10 offers plenty of options to customize the experience, so you can always adapt it to suit your particular needs.

Which is to say, Josh's review is pretty much spot on, and you can't go wrong with the E-M10. Great work.
