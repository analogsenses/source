Wonderful special feature on Apple's website about the history of the Mac. It all started in 1984 with a boyish-looking Steve Jobs and the promise of insanely great things. 30 years later, the Mac has become an iconic piece of technology that empowers artists, designers, writers and many more creative professionals to be the very best they can be. It has literally changed the world; it's made a dent in the Universe.

Without the Mac, none of the things I do for a living would be the same; none of them would be as enjoyable, as empowering or as fun. Some of them would not even exist.

It is no exaggeration to say the Mac has changed my life.

Happy belated birthday, Mac. May you live to be a hundred.
