Matt Gemmell takes issue with the term _blog_:

> Instead of a _blog,_ let your site _be_ a site. Or a journal. An online anthology. Your collected works. Your essays, to date. Your _body of writing_. A blog is a non-thing; it’s the refusal to categorise what you produce, and an implicit opt-in to the disappointing default.

> Instead of _posts,_ you have articles. Pieces. Essays. Stories. Poems. Briefs. Tutorials. White papers. Analyses. Even thoughts, if you like. Actual _works,_ crafted and presented for the reader, instead of just being punctured by a push-pin, and affixed to a bulletin board, beside _lost dog,_ and _roommate wanted._

I emphatically agree. I never refer to myself as a blogger, or this site as a blog. Analog Senses is most definitely a website, and what I write and publish here are certainly not blog posts in my mind. On that note, Matt’s piece actually provides a very nice segue into my next article, but more on that later.
