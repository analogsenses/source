Continuing with the borderline-creepy [coincidences](http://www.analogsenses.com/2014/09/29/ios-8-does-movie-quote-predictions/), today I came across this interview, and the moment could not be better. I'm just coming off binge-watching Joss Whedon's excellent but short-lived TV series, [Firefly](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0303461/), and its movie sequel, [Serenity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/):

> **Is there, and this is a weird thing to say, but is there a trap to being typecast as awesome?**

> \[Laughs\] I don’t know. “Typecast as awesome.” Am I? You look at Malcolm Reynolds, that guy was pretty awesome. Not because he was super and unstoppable; he lost all the time. His victories were tiny. And he’ll take ’em. It took very little to make that guy happy. As long as he was sticking it to the right guy, and walking away with being able to walk, he was cool.

As soon as I watched the pilot, Malcolm Reynolds instantly became one of my favorite fictional characters of all time. It's extremely rare to see a character so well established, so deep-layered and complex, and yet so relatable in every way. 

I always liked Fillion well enough, but his incredible performances on Firefly and Serenity have made me appreciate him as an actor on a whole different level. And judging from this interview —as well as numerous others I've seen over the years— he seems to be a pretty decent human being, too.
