If you think there's no way in the world you could ever be interested in reading a review of an ink bottle, you're probably not alone.

Fortunately, Josh Ginter easily proves you —and me— wrong in his excellent review of the popular Pilot Iroshizuku Kon-Peki, a truly beautiful shade of blue wrapped in an unbelievably gorgeous package. 

So much so, in fact, that I'm finding myself increasingly curious to try a piston-filler fountain pen just to have an excuse to get one of those awesome bottles of ink.

On a side note, I love how Josh keeps changing the header image on The Newsprint with each new article. It's a fantastic way to keep the site looking fresh, and it instantly lets readers know that there's new, awesome content waiting to be read. I think it's a really cool design feature and I wish it was more broadly used throughout the Internet.
