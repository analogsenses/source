Raphael Minder, The New York Times:

> MADRID — How is it that a baby-faced, 20-year-old university student skates his way into the coronation celebration of the new king, passes himself off as a government adviser to reportedly broker a lucrative business deal, and avoids traffic jams by flashing a fake police light?

> That is the question members of [Spain](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/spain/index.html?inline=nyt-geo)’s security services are asking themselves after the student, Francisco Nicolás Gómez Iglesias, was arrested last week and quickly [gained prominence](http://www.elconfidencial.com/espana/2014-10-21/los-negocios-del-pequeno-nicolas-y-sus-relaciones-con-los-empresarios-de-madrid_376036/) as the country’s most notorious gate-crasher.

> The answer, disturbingly enough, is that he did it by falsifying police and secret service documents and pretending to hold several government and other official posts, [Spain](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/spain/index.html?inline=nyt-geo)’s national police say.

How incredibly embarrassing. If it were a movie I'd have trouble believing it.

Also, the damned kid stole my idea. What am I going to do now with all these forged passports?
