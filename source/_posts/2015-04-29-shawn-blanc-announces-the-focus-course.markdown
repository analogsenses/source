This is a big day for Shawn. After many, many months working his ass off, today he finally unveiled the landing page for his upcoming course on productivity. In his own words:

> At the end of the day, **it's all about giving our time and energy to the things which are meaningful**. I want a lifestyle that is conducive to doing my best creative work without sacrificing a healthy work/life balance to get there.

> **Living with diligence and focus is not a personality type — it's a skill we can learn.**

The Focus Course is a massive undertaking, and also a massive accomplishment. I’m really happy for Shawn, and I’m convinced it’s going to be a smashing success. If you care about productivity and living a life with purpose, you owe it to yourself to check it out.
