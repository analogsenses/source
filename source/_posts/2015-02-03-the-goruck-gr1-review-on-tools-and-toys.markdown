Speaking of gorgeous reviews, Ben Brooks did a great take on the GORUCK GR1 for Tools & Toys:

> What makes the GR1 great is its versatility. I have no qualms about doing anything with this bag. Iâ€™ve taken it hiking and traveling, to on job interviews, and to the park where my kid saw fit to drag it through the mud. It still looks the same as it did when it was new. It still functions the same.

> Every little thing works. I can just as easily use this bag for clothes as I can bricks, as I can a laptop, or as I can with other delicate and expensive gadgets. The GR1 became my only bag, not because it was the perfect bag, but because it can be _any_ kind of bag I need it to be.

This is exactly right. I don't personally own the GR1, because I needed a smaller bag and I went for the GR Echo instead. Since I already own a GR2 and a GR Echo, buying the GR1 always seemed a bit excessive. However, it's true that the GR2 is too big for everyday use and the Echo is too small for travel, and I do miss having a bag that is just the right size for almost everything. After reading Ben's excellent review, I may have to reconsider my position.

As a side note, I'm really loving the Tools & Toys reviews lately. The thought and care that go into every article really shine through, and the standards are incredibly high. This is why I'm so proud to be a contributor to the site.
