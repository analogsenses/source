Fun video review from Kai, as usual. As for the camera itself, let me get this straight:

* No video mode
* No brass body
* No Live View
* $5,195

At least this one does have an LCD screen, unlike the infamous [Leica 60](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/spanish/c/product/1083146-REG/leica_10779_m_typ_240_edition.html).
