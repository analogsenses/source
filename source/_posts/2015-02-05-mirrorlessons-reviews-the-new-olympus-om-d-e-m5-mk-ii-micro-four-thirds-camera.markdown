Great review by Mathiew of MirrorLessons. The E-M5 Mk II has many people excited, and with good reason. It’s a spectacular camera and it’s sure to be another home run for Olympus. The main benefits compared to the original E-M5 are the improved control layout, an electronic shutter which goes up to 1/16,000 and is completely silent, the improved 5-axis IBIS, freeze-proof weather sealing and the new high-resolution mode which is capable of shooting 40 MP images by slightly shifting the sensor and stitching multiple shots together. All in all, it sounds like a pretty cool refresh and if you’re in the market for a new camera, it’s a no-brainer.

That being said, if you already own one of the other OM-D bodies, I don’t think the new features add enough functionality to justify the upgrade cost. Sure, new features are always nice to have but deep down, all OM-D cameras share the same sensor and all except the old E-M5 share even the same image processor, so there’s not a whole lot of improvement to be had in the image quality department. 

Once you own a relatively nice camera body like the E-M10, the E-M1 or even the old E-M5, you have everything your need to take amazing images. I’m super happy with my E-M10 and I don’t feel like I’ve come close to outgrowing it yet, so I have no plans to upgrade to this new E-M5. And to be perfectly honest, I also don’t want to get into a habit of upgrading my camera every year. In my opinion, and these are just my two cents, it makes a lot more sense to buy additional lenses instead, which is where the real benefits are.
