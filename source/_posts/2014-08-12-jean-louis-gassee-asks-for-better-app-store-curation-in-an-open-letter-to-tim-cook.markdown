[Jean-Louis Gassée asks for better App Store curation in an open letter to Tim Cook | Monday Note](http://www.mondaynote.com/2014/08/10/app-store-curation-an-open-letter-to-tim-cook/)

Jean-Louis Gassée, on this week's Monday Note:



<blockquote>With one million titles and no human guides, the Apple App Store has become incomprehensible for mere mortals. A simple solution exists: curation by humans instead of algorithms.</blockquote>



I couldn't agree more. Human curation and an editorial selection of apps are becoming indispensable in today's extremely crowded App Store. If Apple wants high-quality apps to thrive and independent developers to keep making great apps, this is the way forward.
