If I had to summarize [the newly announced Fuji X-T10](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X7QTUB4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00X7QTUB4&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=QLHUJ6DA2QNWIC5H) camera in one sentence, I’d say it’s Fujifilm’s answer to the [Olympus OM-D E-M10](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HPQ09H6/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HPQ09H6&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=QOU4MUS34NVCOZ33): a full-featured, affordable camera in a serious, high-quality body for people who are ready to start getting serious about photography.

The X-T10 has the same X-Trans APS-C sensor as Fuji’s top-shelf camera, the X-T1, so IQ should be stellar. It also has a full array of dedicated manual controls and the new AF modes that were just introduced in the X-T1’s 4.0 firmware update, as well as an electronic shutter than can go up to 1/32,000th of a second.

I’m intrigued. On paper, the new X-T10 gives the X-T1 a heck of a run for its money. With such a compelling feature set, solid body and a relatively affordable entry price, it could very well grow to become Fuji’s next big hit and the most popular X-series camera.

The Fuji X-T10 will start at $799 body only and will be released in June 2015. It is currently [available for preorder on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00X7QTUB4/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00X7QTUB4&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=QLHUJ6DA2QNWIC5H).
