Ben Thompson:

> Indeed, for now I think it likely that one of Apple’s oldest and most cherished skills — it’s ability to make beautiful, desirable objects — will make the Watch exactly what Tim Cook promised: another tentpole product that rivals the Mac, the iPod, the iPad, and even the iPhone. Framed as nothing more than [A Watch that Does Stuff](http://exponent.fm/episode-045-its-a-watch-that-does-stuff/) — and that you actually don’t mind wearing — Apple will rightly sell enough to kick-start a world that gets just a little bit smarter and little bit better when it knows who and where we are.

I think Ben’s right on the money here. The entire piece is full of clever, insightful analysis, as usual.
