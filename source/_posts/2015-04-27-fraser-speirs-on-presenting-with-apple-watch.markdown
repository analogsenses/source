Never in a million years would it have occurred to me to use Apple Watch as a presenting aid. I mean, you'd think there are enough things distracting you already when youâ€™re on stage.

The funny thing is, apparently it works, and it works well. Although I found it funny that Fraser actually recommends _taking the watch off_ when using it as a remote:

> You want to have the face of the watch nestling in your cupped fingers. The same place you'd interact with a TV remote or a more traditional presenter's remote. I found that taking the watch off, re-closing the sport band and placing three fingers through the band, in the way that you might pick up a watch to look at it, was an effective way to hold it. The most important thing here is that you don't distract your audience by fiddling to switch slides and you don't make a mistake when navigating.

I seriously doubt this is the usage pattern Apple had in mind when designing the Keynote watch app but hey, whatever works.
