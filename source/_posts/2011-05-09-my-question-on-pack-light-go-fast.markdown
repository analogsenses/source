OK, so first of all, thank you so much UriÂ for answering, and specially for doing it so soon (it's been only about three hours since I sent the question).

I am a huge fan of [Pack light. Go Fast.](http://packlite.tumblr.com/), a blog about the art of packing light and the freedom it gives you. It includes a ton of great tips to get rid of the stuff you don't need to bring with you on a trip, so that you can focus on having a great time wherever you go.

I have been wanting to buy one of the excellent [Goruck backpacks](http://www.goruck.com/shop/) for my trips for quite some time now, but I wasn't sure which one to pick. Uri's answer is great, reasoned, and pretty much just what I needed. Go read it for the details.

Thanks!
