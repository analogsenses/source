My review of the [Ascaso i-Mini](http://amzn.to/29kjlYz) coffee grinder was published today on _Tools & Toys_. I’ve owned the i-Mini for over three years now, and it’s one impressive little device.

If you’re at all interested in coffee, you probably know that good, high-end burr grinders are expensive, with the three or four most popular models costing between $350-$1,000. Unless you’re an enthusiast, that’s a lot of money to drop on a grinder.

What’s remarkable about the i-Mini is that it can do almost everything these high-end grinders do, but it does it while keeping the price well under $300. In a community where fancy devices almost invariably carry a hefty premium, that’s no small feat.
