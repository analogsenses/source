Jordan Steele:

> For many, when the temperatures drop and the snow starts falling, the first impulse is to cozy up inside and pack the gear away. However, I’ve found that the coldest mornings and sometimes even during somewhat heavy snowfall, the conditions can align to provide something special. Obviously, shooting in a blizzard isn’t a great idea most of the time: it can be dangerous as well as yield poor images, as very little can be visible in these situations, but steady snowfall or cold temperatures can lead to some very nice opportunities.
