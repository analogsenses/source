Adam Liptak, writing for _The New York Times_:

> In a long-sought victory for the gay rights movement, the [Supreme Court](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/s/supreme_court/index.html?inline=nyt-org) ruled on Friday that the Constitution guarantees a nationwide right to [same-sex marriage](http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/subjects/s/same_sex_marriage/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier).

> Justice Anthony M. Kennedy wrote the majority opinion in the 5 to 4 decision. He was joined by the courtâ€™s four more liberal justices.

Huge day. This calls for a celebration.
