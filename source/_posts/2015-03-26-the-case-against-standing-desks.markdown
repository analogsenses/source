Rishabh R. Dassani:

> **Standing** as a default behavior choice doesn’t work for a variety of reasons:

> The first and the most important reason standing doesn’t work is because it isn’t productive. Standing **and** working at the same time affects overall performance because you’re focusing on two things. Having to distribute your cognitive capacities between standing and working nullifies the benefits you might get from standing alone because only part of your mental resources are going toward your work, thus making you less productive in the end.

I don’t know if I agree with that but until today, I had seen plenty of posts about how great standing desks are and not one post with an opposing view. It’s always good to hear both sides of an argument, particularly when scientific studies on the matter are not conclusive.
