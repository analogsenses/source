What a fantastic idea for a Kickstarter project. It's a beautiful deck of cards with helpful tips for writers who are stuck.

Via [John Gruber](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/11/11/writer-emergency-pack), who adds:

> Nicely illustrated and designed (including excellent use of Univers). It’s a Kickstarter campaign that aimed small and has exploded way past their original goal. But the coolest thing is they’re donating packs of the cards to youth writing programs, and the more decks they sell, the cheaper each deck becomes to produce, and the more they’ll have to donate.

If you do any type of long-form writing regularly, either professionally or as a hobby, this is well worth your consideration.
