["What If" book announced | xkcd](http://blog.xkcd.com/2014/03/12/what-if-i-wrote-a-book/)

This just made my day:



<blockquote>As I’ve sifted through the letters submitted to What If every week, I’ve occasionally set aside particularly neat questions that I wanted to spend a little more time on. This book features my answers to those questions, along with revised and updated versions of some of my favorite articles from the site. I’m also including my personal list of the weirdest questions people have submitted.</blockquote>



Instant preorder. Seriously, go.
