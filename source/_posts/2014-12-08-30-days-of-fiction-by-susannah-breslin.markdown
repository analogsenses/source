Susannah Breslin:

> Inspired by a 30-day yoga challenge at my yoga studio, I'm writing 30 [flash fictions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flash_fiction) in 30 days. One a day. 100 words or less. Time limit: 15 minutes. You can read all of them [here](http://susannahbreslin.net/blog?tag=30+DAYS+OF+FICTION).

These are amazing.
