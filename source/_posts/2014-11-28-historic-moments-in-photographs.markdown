Bored Panda:

> The photograph precipitated a dramatic change in how we perceive history. Amazing historic photos like these can make it seem like you were standing right there during that historic moment.

> Books and paintings have documented history far further back, but there's nothing like a photo to give you the sense that you're looking at something real. A photo can still misdirect the viewer, but it's still more faithful than a painting or book.

What a fantastic collection of pictures; it would be nearly impossible to pick one. 

That said, [this one](http://www.boredpanda.com/nikola-tesla-sitting-in-his-laboratory-with-his-magnifying-transmitter/) of Nikola Tesla calmly sitting in his laboratory while being surrounded by lightning is pretty damn badass.
