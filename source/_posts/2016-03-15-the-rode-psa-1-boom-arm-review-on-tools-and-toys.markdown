My review of the [Rode PSA-1 boom arm](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001D7UYBO/?tag=analogsens-20) was published today on _Tools & Toys_.

This was a fun product to review. As some of you may know, I recently launched [a photography podcast](http://www.candid.fm) alongside [Josh Ginter](http://thenewsprint.co) and [Marius Masalar](http://mariusmasalar.me), and choosing the right gear to get started was a crucial part of that process.

On one hand, I didn’t want to spend a fortune on gear, especially when there was no guarantee that this would be a profitable business. On the other hand, I didn’t want to sound terrible, either, and I _definitely_ didn’t want to sound a lot worse than my two co-hosts, so it was a matter of finding the right compromise for me.

In the end I settled on borrowing an XLR microphone from my father’s FM radio station. It turned out to be an old [Shure 10A dynamic microphone](http://cdn.shure.com/user_guide/upload/352/us_pro_10a_ug.pdf) (now discontinued), which on paper is a rather basic model, but it just so happens to work incredibly well with my voice. I also needed to buy a [Tascam US 2x2 audio interface](http://www.amazon.com/TASCAM-US-2x2-USB-Audio-Interface/dp/B00MIXF2RS/?tag=analogsens-20) to connect the microphone to my computer.

Being a dynamic microphone, though, the Shure 10A is _extremely_ picky about my posture, and requires consistent technique to sound any good. It soon became clear that a traditional desk stand just wouldn’t do, so I decided to invest in the Rode PSA-1 boom arm and I never looked back.

The Rode PSA-1 is a great product: it is very solid, and it offers all the features of more expensive studio arms at a very reasonable price point. What’s not to love?

All things considered, I spent about $250 total for my setup, and I’m really happy with how well it’s working for me. I can’t recommend the Rode PSA-1 boom arm enough, especially if you own a dynamic microphone, or are planning to get one anytime soon.

As a side bonus, I recorded [a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OvL0RfbY8A) for the review, where I go over the main advantages of having a boom arm vs a desk stand for your microphone. You can find it embedded below. I’m well aware there’s lots of things to improve as far as production goes, but for a first attempt at a multiple-camera video, I’m quite happy with how it turned out.

It’s not _that_ bad, is it? Especially considering this was my first time ever working with Adobe Premiere Pro and I only had a couple hours to assemble the final cut before submitting the review to the editor. I cringe here and there every time I watch it, and there’s definitely a couple things I would have done differently had I had more time to work on the edit, but I think for a first attempt it’s pretty respectable.
