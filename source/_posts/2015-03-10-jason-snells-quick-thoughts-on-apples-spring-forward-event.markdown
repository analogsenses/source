Jason Snell has another nice and comprehensive overview of everything that was announced yesterday, as well as his take on what we can realistically expect from each of the announcements. I found myself silently nodding in agreement as I read most of this piece, so I'd like to just point you towards it without further commentary. Enjoy.
