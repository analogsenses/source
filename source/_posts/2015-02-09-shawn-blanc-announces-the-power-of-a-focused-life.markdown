I’ve been waiting for this book to be announced since this past Summer, when Shawn started talking about it on his [members-only](http://shawnblanc.net/members/) podcast, Shawn Today. It’s a topic I’m incredibly interested in, and I don’t think there’s anyone better than Shawn to guide us through it. In [his own words](http://shawnblanc.net/2015/02/power-of-a-focused-life/):

> In short, _The Power of a Focused Life_ is about living without regret in the Age of Distraction. I’ll admit, it sounds a bit melodramatic — but I’m serious. I’ve been working on this book for over a year. I’ve spent hundreds of hours reading and doing research (with much more to do still). And I’ve been applying these principles and ideas to my own life for over a decade.

Shawn has always been one to walk the talk, and it shows. His previous book, [_Delight is in the Details_](http://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/), literally changed my life and was one of my main inspirations when I decided to take my chances with Analog Senses. I trust Shawn, and usually share his views on life, work and the relationship between them. I couldn’t be more excited to read what he has to say about this.

Also, whatever you do, don’t miss that introductory video. Now _that's_ how you announce a product.
