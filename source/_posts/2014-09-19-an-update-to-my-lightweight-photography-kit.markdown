_NOTE: This is an update to my article on [how to build a lightweight photography kit for the urban professional](http://www.analogsenses.com/2014/08/21/building-a-lightweight-photography-kit-for-the-urban-professional/). I have updated the original article to add this information, but I'm including it here separately for those of you who already read that piece._

Lately I've been experimenting with an old analog SLR that belonged to my father. It's a [Canon AE-1 Program](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_AE-1_Program), one of the most popular 35mm film SLR's from the 80's. It's in absolutely mint condition and it just pained me to see it unused, so I grabbed it a couple months ago and I've been playing with it since then.

Fortunately, this camera also fits inside the RR Field Pocket without any issues, maybe even better than the E-M10. Despite being a 35mm film SLR —this sensor size is what we'd call "full-frame" in the digital world—, the body of the AE-1 Program is remarkably compact. As for the lens, I've been shooting with the kit lens, a [Canon FDn 50mm f/1.8](http://camerapedia.wikia.com/wiki/Canon_FD_50mm_f/1.8), which is pretty good, giving sharp images and decent bokeh. I also recently purchased a used [Canon FDn 35mm f/2.0 lens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_FD_35mm_f/2) on ebay, which is fantastic for street photography. It's the fastest Canon FD lens in this focal length, but it's even smaller —although a bit heavier— than the Panasonic Leica 25mm f1.4 for Micro Four Thirds

Shooting with this camera is awesome. It's manual-zoom only, and it supports full manual operation as well as full auto-exposure and shutter-priority modes. I love it. I usually shoot in shutter-priority mode. I'll probably end up going full manual, but in the meantime, having these extra modes is certainly helpful.

So far I'm loving the experience of shooting film, and I would recommend anyone to try it. The good news is, you can get a high-end 35mm film SLR and a pretty good lens for under $100 on ebay, easy. I think it's a great creative exercise because it forces you to be much more thoughtful and deliberate about your photography, and that's good. Full auto-everything doesn't make you a better photographer; being 100% responsible for the image you capture does.
