Ole C. Salomonsen:

> SOARING is a shortfilm showing what is keeping many photographers sleepless through the winter nights in the arctic landscapes and rural areas of northern Norway; the northern lights. The film was shot this autumn from late august to mid november in and around the areas of the city of TromsÃ¸, as well as on the beautiful island of Senja.

> All sequences are realtime video, no timelapse used.
