Sometimes it’s easy to become complacent with your smartphone platform of choice and ignore what competitors are doing. If you’re a long-time iOS user, as I am, you probably look at Android phones with a certain ambivalence. But how long has it been since you checked out an Android phone objectively, without letting your opinion be biased by Apple’s marketing machine?

Luckily, my friend and [co-host](http://www.candid.fm) Marius Masalar spent the past few weeks testing the new Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and comparing the experience with his existing iPhone 6s Plus. You know, for Science.

This is a fair, thorough, and all-around excellent write-up, and I greatly enjoyed reading along as Marius slowly figured out the kinks in the experience and reached his eventual conclusion. I don’t want to spoil it for you, so I won’t be quoting any excerpts here. Suffice it to say, this one deserves to be read slowly, preferably with a hot beverage in hand.

Normally I would have included this link in the Top Five section of [today’s Morning Coffee](/2016/03/27/morning-coffee/), but I do believe this series is strong enough to merit its own separate post. If you haven’t been following along, check out [Part 1](http://mariusmasalar.me/samsung-galaxy-s7-day-1/) and enjoy.
