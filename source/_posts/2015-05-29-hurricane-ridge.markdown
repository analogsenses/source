Beautiful post by Erin Brooks:

> Having a 1 and a 3 year old at home means we aren’t doing as much travel as we’d like these days, although we do try to get out for quick local trips in the beautiful Pacific Northwest. A couple of weekends ago, we took our girls and went on a day trip to the Olympic National Park, and spent some time hiking Hurricane Ridge.

I love Erin’s eye for photography. The way she captures the natural beauty of the landscape — and her family — is amazing.
