[Nobody needs to buy tablets any more, says Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/08/op-ed-tables-really-are-pcsbecause-theres-no-point-in-buying-new-ones/)

Peter Bright makes an interesting case:



<blockquote>It turns out that tablets aren't the new smartphone and they're not going to provide regular sales at high price points. They're the new PC; if you've already got one, there's not much reason to buy a new one. Their makers are all out of ideas and they can't make them better. They can only make them cheaper. </blockquote>



That's a bold thing to say when we are less than a couple of months removed from a new generation of iPads. We shall see.
