Marco Arment, on Yahoo's acquisition of Tumblr:



<blockquote>Anyone who knows David can tell, very clearly, that he wrote every word of his announcement post. Not only did Yahoo let him end it like that, but the subhead on their official press release shows that Tumblr and Yahoo are seeing eye-to-eye on quite a lot already. In many ways, this feels more like a merger than an acquisition.</blockquote>



A great insider's look at Tumblr's history. This deal has so much potential for both companies, I really hope things work out between them. And it goes to show how passionate people can make a difference. Congratulations to everyone over at Tumblr (and Yahoo!). And congratulations to Marco, as well.
