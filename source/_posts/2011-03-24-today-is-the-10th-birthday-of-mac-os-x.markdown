[Today is the 10th Birthday of Mac OS X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X)

Wow. 10 years. 6 Big Cats, and counting ([Lion](http://www.apple.com/macosx/lion/) is right around the corner). It's been quite a ride so far. And the best is yet to come.

Here's to 10 more years of Awesomeness,

Cheers!
