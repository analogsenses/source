Jonathan Poritsky, writing at _The Candler Blog_:

> My own website is a simple proposition. Here’s a space where I can put out the best writing I’m capable of. I own every pixel here. That concept will never go out of fashion, even if it fades from the limelight.

> I honestly don’t know whether or not there will always be a Google or a Facebook to help readers find me. I do know that I’m in control of whether or not there’s a _candler blog_.

Jonathan’s thinking here is very similar to what recently moved Brent Simmons [to delete all his tweets](/2015/05/04/brent-simmons-is-the-man-who-deleted-all-his-tweets/).
