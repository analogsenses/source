John Gruber has published an amazingly in-depth analysis about the hypothetical display resolutions that could work well for the upcoming new iPhone models, which are rumored to sport bigger displays, at 4.7 and 5.5 inches.

Gruber's logic is sound, and I agree with his conclusions. It all hinges on this:

<blockquote>But what they have never done, and I believe never will do, is redefine the virtual point to something other than 1/44th the recommended minimum tap target size for every device.</blockquote>

Tap target size has been a constant since the original iPhone, and with good reason. After all, your fingers haven't gotten any smaller in the past 8 years, have they?
