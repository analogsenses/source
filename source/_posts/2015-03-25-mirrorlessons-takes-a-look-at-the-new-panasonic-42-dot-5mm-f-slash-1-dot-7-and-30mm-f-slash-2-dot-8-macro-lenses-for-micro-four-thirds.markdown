These are two _very_ interesting new lenses for the MFT system, particularly the 42.5mm lens, which will be a direct competitor to the amazing [Olympus 45mm f/1.8 lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00CI3R53W/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00CI3R53W&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=ZP4DKIWZOO5CC3EI):

> The 42.5mm has some interesting characteristics however. It has an all-metal finish which should prove more resistant than the plastic finish of the M.Zuiko 45mm. But what I like the most are its close focusing capabilities (30cm) which is closer than the Olympus version. The lens seems to deliver excellent image quality with great sharpness at f/1.7. Like the M.Zuiko version, this is another lens that really proves how great the MFT system can be: so small yet such excellent IQ. It also has optical stabilisation which naturally makes it a better choice for Lumix users. The autofocus was really fast with the Lumix GX7.

I own the Olympus lens and it's easily one of the best deals in the the entire MFT system. I'm really curious to see how this new Panasonic lens stacks up against it.
