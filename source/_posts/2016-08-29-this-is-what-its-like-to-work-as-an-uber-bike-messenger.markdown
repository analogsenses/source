Really great piece over at _The Billfold_:

> The most appealing aspect of working as a bike courier — on top of its power to burn calories — is the glimpse it offers you into the private worlds and habits of New Yorkers. I frequently took on the role of an armchair anthropologist, privileged with brief glimpses into the modern dwellings and workplaces of New Yorkers of all stripes.

It’s definitely not all rosy, but if there’s one city in the whole world where I wouldn’t mind trying something like this, it’s gotta be New York.
