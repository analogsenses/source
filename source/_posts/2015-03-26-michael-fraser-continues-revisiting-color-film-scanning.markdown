Now we’re getting somewhere. I’m really liking how thorough and efficient the new workflow is. And he’s still not done:

> All of this (including the points in Part 1) can be made into a Lightroom preset and Photoshop Action, with the only routine user intervention being the selection of a grey point in step 1 and pressing “Auto” in step 3.  The (huge) benefit to this is that you can quickly preview the positive (but uncorrected) images before proceeding with the full conversion, which itself is only 2-3 clicks away.

> My target, however, is to remove even this much intervention.

You have my undivided attention, sir.
