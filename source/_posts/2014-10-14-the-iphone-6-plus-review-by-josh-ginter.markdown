Excellent review of the iPhone 6 Plus over at Tools and Toys. I was really looking forward to a review that focused more on the personal side of these devices, and not so much on the technical aspects. Josh nailed this perfectly:

> Of course, the star performer of this show is that beautifully gigantic 5.5″ screen. I believe the specification goes something like “401 PPI”, which means **sharp** in English. 

Also, his photography is outstanding, as usual. 

I love the warmth that Josh captures in his pictures, it gives a great sense of personality that is uniquely his. In my opinion, he makes the device look even better than in Apple's own promotional materials.
