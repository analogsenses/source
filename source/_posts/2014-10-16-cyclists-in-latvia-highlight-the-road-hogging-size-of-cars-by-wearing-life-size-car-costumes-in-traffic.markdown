EDW Lynch, Laughing Squid:

> To highlight how much more road a car requires than a bicycle, a group of cyclists recently [donned car costumes](http://vk.com/letsbikeit?z=photo-18332841_338886749%2Fwall-18332841_18770) and took to the streets of Riga in Latvia for a whimsical protest.

This is awesome.
