Jason Snell:

> Then another leadership shift occurred, the sixth in 24 months. The new bosses were actually my old bosses, and they knew exactly how I was feeling about my job and the prospect of going through more painful changes. To their great credit, they allowed us to end our relationship amicably. I thank them for their support and their generosity. They even asked me to write a final front-of-the-book column in the November issue of Macworld.

> Unfortunately, many of my colleagues lost their jobs today. If there's anything I can do to help them, I will. I have had time to plan for this day, but they haven't. You probably know some of them. Please join with me in giving them sympathy and support.

Wow. I wasn't expecting that. Macworld has been the reference publication for all things Apple for as long as I can remember. It will be extremely strange to see most of them go.

Really sad news. Jason Snell will be joining Relay FM, so we'll get to hear more of him in the coming weeks.
