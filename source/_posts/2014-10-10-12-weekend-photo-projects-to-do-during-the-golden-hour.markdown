Chris Gampat, The Phoblographer:

> The [Golden Hour](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/04/05/five-things-know-shooting-golden-hour/) is one of the best times for you to go out and shoot photos. But this weekend, you only have a small window to time to go out there and do it. So make the most of it! Here are some projects to get you started!
