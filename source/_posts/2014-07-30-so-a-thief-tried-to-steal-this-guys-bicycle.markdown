<blockquote>After a long day at work in Times Square, I find my bike locked with a mysterious Kryptonite U-lock. It's an old trick. The thief will come back in the dead of night, release their lock, and pop my chain with a bolt-cutter. But I ain't givin up that easy.</blockquote>

This is awesome on so many levels.
