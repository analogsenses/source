My review of the GORUCK GR Echo was published today on Tools & Toys. I love GORUCK bags. I use the GR Echo almost every day for a million different things, and I never leave my house for more than three days without my GR2. In my mind, these are easily some of the best bags money can buy, and I’m thrilled to have had the chance to review the two that I own for Tools & Toys.

I think Tools & Toys is definitely becoming the best place on the Web for in-depth reviews of quality items, and I couldn’t be more proud to see my own work up there on the homepage. It’s an absolute privilege to be able to work with such talented people, and I can’t get enough of it.

As a side note, I arranged my first photo shoot ever with a model for this article and I have to say, I’m super happy with the results. I hope you guys enjoy it as well. And if you’d like to check out all the pictures from the session, I’ve prepared [a Flickr album](https://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/sets/72157651044260567/) with the full-size images.
