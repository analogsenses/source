Alice Yoo, My Modern Met:

> Photographers have become enamored with the location. At night when the huge skyscrapers shine their lights, they cast surreal reflections on the surrounding water. Many photographers have created beautiful composites that show crystal clear reflections of its stunning skyline. They give the photos a futuristic feel. Others simply capture the beauty of the night.

I love these images. Via [Coudal](http://coudal.com/archives/2014/12/busan_south_kor.php).
