Jim Dalrymple, on the recent wave on enthusiasm/criticism about iOS 7:



<blockquote>Second—and I’m surprised I even have to say this—it’s a beta for developers. This is not a build any individual user should install—ever. It wasn’t meant for you and installing it shouldn’t even be on your radar.</blockquote>



Agreed.
