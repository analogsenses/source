Today is the most special day of the year in men's tennis calendar: the day of the Wimbledon final. Roger Federer will try to win a unprecedented 8th Wimbledon title against Novak Djokovic, the 2011 champion:



<blockquote>Of course, we need look back only 12 months to find a player who did not blow the opposition away in every match throughout the Fortnight, but then came spectacularly good in the final to win in straight sets. Djokovic was on the wrong end of the result that day, and funnily enough will be intent upon reversing the story this time around. He may well succeed. But Federer will grab this latest chance – we have surely learned by now not to describe it as his last – with both hands. The 2014 final is an absolutely intriguing prospect.</blockquote>



For all intents and purposes, Novak Djokovic should be the favorite to win today. But you should count Federer out only at your own risk.

Federer is well past his prime and yet, there's still something special about his game; a certain kind of magic no one can match. The grass of Centre Court is where he's been most successful, a place where he seems able to turn back the clock to his awe-inspiring days. It is truly a joy to watch.
