My review of Peak Design's Capture Clip was published today over at _Tools & Toys_. This small accessory was something I purchased a few months ago, mostly out of curiosity, but it has grown to become essential in my kit. These days I can't imagine going out for a shoot without having it attached to my bag.



It's surprising just how often you need to use your hands on any given shoot. The Capture is a fantastic way to quickly and securely set your camera aside for a moment, and do whatever it is you need to do without being worried about dropping it. It provides essential peace of mind, and that's something you can't put a price on.

If you're interested in something like that — and you probably should be — head on over to _Tools & Toys_ for the full review.
