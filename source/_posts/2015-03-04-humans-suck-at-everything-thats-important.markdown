David Cain:

> Essentially, this higher territory is what we call morality, and I think we tend to _greatly_ overestimate how good we are at it. We’re a species who, as I [point out frequently](http://www.raptitude.com/2014/12/the-myth-of-new-years/), can barely uphold our New Year’s commitments to _ourselves_, yet we seem to expect everyone else to be more or less upstanding and incorruptible. Why am I so frequently appalled by how thoughtlessly other people park their cars, when I don’t think twice about spending thirty dollars on beer instead of feeding the starving?

Food for thought.
