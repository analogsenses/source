Marcin Wichary:

<blockquote>Chicago is a city of bridges but, more importantly for that one weekend day in April 2011, Chicago is a city of movable bridges.

Every spring, a few times a week, twenty-seven bridges open in sequence to allow the boats to get to the lakeâ€¦ and every fall that sequence is reversed.</blockquote>
