Marco Arment:

> The problem seems to be quite simple: they’re doing too much, with unrealistic deadlines.

> We don’t need major OS releases every year. We don’t need each OS release to have a huge list of new features. We need our computers, phones, and tablets to _work well first_ so we can enjoy new features released at a healthy, gradual, sustainable pace.

This article deftly puts into words the general feeling of uncertainty we’re starting to see in the Apple community regarding the rapidly-declining quality of Apple’s software.

> Marco is right but perhaps his framing is too narrow. This simply isn’t an issue that developers grouse about and move on from. This is something that, at least in my experience, has been affecting customers who have otherwise loved their Apple devices.

When these perceptions reach beyond the developer community and start affecting regular users, you know you have a serious problem.
