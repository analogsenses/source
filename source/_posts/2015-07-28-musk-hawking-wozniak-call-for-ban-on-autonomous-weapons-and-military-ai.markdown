Sebastian Anthony, writing for _Ars Technica_:

> A very large number of scientific and technological luminaries have signed an open letter calling for the world's governments to ban the development of “offensive autonomous weapons” to prevent a “military AI arms race.”

> The [letter](http://futureoflife.org/AI/open_letter_autonomous_weapons), which will be presented at the International Joint Conferences on Artificial Intelligence ([IJCAI](http://ijcai-15.org/)) in Buenos Aires tomorrow, is signed by Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk, Noam Chomsky, the Woz, and dozens of other AI and robotics researchers.

When so many super-smart people agree on something, we probably should listen.
