My review of the [Sony Zeiss FE 55mm f/1.8 Sonnar T*](http://amzn.to/1LWCPMz) lens was published today over at _Tools & Toys_.

I’ll be the first to admit that, just by looking at the specs, this 55mm f/1.8 lens sounds a bit pedestrian. However, as you can probably guess just by looking at its $1,000 price tag, this is _not_ your typical nifty-fifty. If you’re considering this lens but are concerned that its performance may not live up to its cost, fear not: this is an incredible piece of glass, easily the best I’ve ever used. It has quickly become my favorite, too.

I don’t know what it is about it. It may be its blistering sharpness, or maybe the contrasty look that just screams of Zeiss quality. It may well be its _gorgeous_ bokeh, or the fact that even though it is a Full Frame lens, it still fits in the palm of my hand.

Either one of these things alone would be enough to justify the purchase of a lens. But when you see them together, well, that’s when you know you’re onto something special.

Incidentally, this is the longest review I’ve ever written for _Tools & Toys_ — or anywhere else, really. There was just so much to say about the lens that I ended up going well past my usual length.
