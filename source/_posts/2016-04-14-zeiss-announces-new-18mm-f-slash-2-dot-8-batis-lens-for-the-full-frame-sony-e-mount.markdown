Just like the rumors had been predicting for months, the long-awaited ultra wide-angle Batis prime is now officially out. It will start shipping in May 2016 for $1,499.

I’m admittedly not a huge fan of the ultra wide-angle range, so this is not super exciting news for me, personally. However, if you’re in the market for a wide prime, this new member of the Batis family looks like yet another amazing performer.
