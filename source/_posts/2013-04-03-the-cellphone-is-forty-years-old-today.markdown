[The cellphone is forty years old today | The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/3/4177844/the-cellphone-is-forty-years-old-today)

Wow. Forty years. That doesn't seem possible:



<blockquote>On April 3rd, 1973, Motorola engineer Marty Cooper placed the first public call from a cellphone. In midtown Manhattan, Cooper called Joel Engel — head of rival research department Bell Labs — saying "Joel, this is Marty. I'm calling you from a cell phone, a real handheld portable cell phone." The call was placed on a Motorola DynaTAC 8000x, which weighed 2.5 pounds, a far cry from today's 4-ounce handsets.</blockquote>



History in the making. That reminds me that the future is ours to invent. Wall will we be talking about forty years from now? It must be something mind-bogglingly great, because if we could imagine it today, we would get there sooner.

We live in [interesting times](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times), alright.
