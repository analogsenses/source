[Manually migrating to a new Mac | Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/2011/06/20/manually-migrating-to-a-new-mac/)

Great news for Mac geeks all around: today is Upgrade Day. OS X Mountain Lion, the next major version of Apple's desktop operating system (previously known as Mac OS X), [is due out today](http://www.macworld.com/article/1167849/apple_to_ship_mountain_lion_on_wednesday.html).

If you're planning to do a clean install, Matt Gemmell [has rescued](http://twitter.com/mattgemmell/status/228052180391845888) this fantastic article that will help you get your Mac ready for the upgrade:



<blockquote>This checklist is for situations where you want to start fresh with a clean installation of OS X and just your essential apps and files, which can provide a general speed boost and may also be a useful preparation for a major new version of OS X.</blockquote>



This may be a good way to kill some time while we wait for John Siracusa's [traditionally epic review of the new OS](http://arstechnica.com/apple/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/), which should also be out later today.

Enjoy, my friends, this day comes by just once a year.
