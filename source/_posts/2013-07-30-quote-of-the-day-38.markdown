<blockquote>It's knowing that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch.</blockquote>

**John Hartford (1937-2001)**, _Gentle On My Mind_. One of my favorite songs, performed by Elvis Presley, Dean Martin and many others, but specially by The Voice himself, Francis Albert Sinatra.

These have to be some of the greatest opening verses of all time.
