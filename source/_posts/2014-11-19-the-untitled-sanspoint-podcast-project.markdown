Richard J. Anderson is back on the podcasting seat:

> [The Untitled Sanspoint Podcast Project](http://www.sanspoint.com/archives/podcast) is a weekly podcast, about technology and culture. It’s fifteen minutes or less, and features only me, talking about what’s caught my attention. It also will feature a plug for something cool. New episodes will be released every Monday, but [Episode 1 is available now, for your listening pleasure](http://www.sanspoint.com/archives/podcast/1-toothpaste-tube/). It’s not on iTunes yet, but should be shortly. In the interim, [you can subscribe by dropping this link in your podcast client of choice](http://www.sanspoint.com/?feed=podcast).

Interesting format. Finding the exact sweet spot both in terms of length and frequency of episodes for a one-man tech podcast is a tricky thing to do well. I find the 15-minute mark to be a natural choice for this type of shows, and here it seems to work well.

From what I've seen so far, I'd say The Untitled Sanspoint Podcast Project is off to a great start.
