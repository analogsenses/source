My review of the SIRUI T-025X travel tripod was published on Tools & Toys today. If size and weight are important to you, I can’t recommend this tripod enough.

As a side note, this review took a lot of work, particularly those long-exposure shots of Madrid’s Gran Vía and Puerta de Alcalá at night. They were very fun to shoot but man, was it cold. The [Live Composite mode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrF6oskFkbk) of my E-M10, together with the Remote Shutter mode of the [Olympus Image Share iPhone app](http://app.olympus-imaging.com/oishare/) made my life a lot easier, but I _really_ need to get myself a pair of touchscreen-compatible gloves.
