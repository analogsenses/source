Fascinating book by photographer [Doug Menuez](http://www.fearlessgenius.org
):

> Doug Menuez was  invited by Steve Jobs and other leading innovators of the Digital Revolution to record their stories of struggle, failure, sacrifice and success. From 1985-2000 he photographed the people who created more jobs and wealth than at any time in human history. Now heâ€™s sharing his rare photos and eyewitness stories through the FEARLESS GENIUS project.

The book looks amazing. It's available [on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1476752699/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1476752699&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=N7TTEK6766OTONS2), but if you'd like to take a peek, Menuez has been sharing excerpts from the book as [amazing](https://www.storehouse.co/stories/o60s5-fearless-genius) [galleries](https://www.storehouse.co/stories/o80n9-steve-jobs) in Storehouse.
