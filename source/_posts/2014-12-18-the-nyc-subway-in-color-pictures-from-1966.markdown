Kelsey Campbell-Dollaghan, Gizmodo:

> Change comes slowly to the subway. Signs hang for decades. Trains are rarely replaced. A new line can take centuries. So the subway captured in these remarkable images by photographer Danny Lyon in 1966 feels almost contemporaryâ€”which is what makes it shocking that they were shot 48 years ago.

I love these stories. Via [Kottke](http://kottke.org/14/12/color-photos-of-the-nyc-subway-from-1966).
