Marco Arment:

> Apple didn’t find a way around the laws of physics. They didn’t somehow unveil a revolutionary battery or screen technology that the world had never seen before. They punted again. In the absence of any better alternative approaches, they just did what they could with today’s technology.

The number of times Apple has caught everyone by surprise by unveiling something truly revolutionary is strikingly small. I can think of the original Macintosh and the original iPhone, and that's basically it. We shouldn't keep expecting them to do the impossible, and then fault them for not keeping up with our own unrealistic expectations.
