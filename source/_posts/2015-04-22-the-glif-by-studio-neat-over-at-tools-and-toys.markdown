I’ve always been curious about the Glif, the nifty little iPhone stand by Studio Neat. Josh Ginter’s fantastic review over at Tools & Toys has confirmed what I’ve long suspected about it: I _really_ should add it to my camera kit.

As a side note, I found this review to be particularly interesting in the photographic department. This is the first time — to the best of my knowledge — I’ve seen a product review [shot with Olympus’s new 40-150mm f/2.8 Pro lens](http://thenewsprint.co/2015/04/21/the-studio-neat-glif-on-tools--toys/), and the results are stellar.
