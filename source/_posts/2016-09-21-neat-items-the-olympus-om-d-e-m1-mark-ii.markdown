My first day at Photokina turned out to be a pretty busy one. I also got some — very limited — hands on time with the brand new Olympus OM-D E-M1 Mark II, and my first impressions were published today on _Tools & Toys_ as part of their fun Neat Items section. Head on over there to find out a bit more about it! [^Em1]
