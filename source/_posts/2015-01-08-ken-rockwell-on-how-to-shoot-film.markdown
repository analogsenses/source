This is a fantastic article with pretty much everything you need to know, whether you're just starting out or attempting to master the craft. 

I particularly loved this bit:

> Shooting film is easy, fun and inexpensive — _exactly_ like riding a bicycle. Both take practice at first, and once learned, you'll never forget. Like riding a bike, film is easy to shoot. By comparison, shooting digital is like trying to pilot the Space Shuttle: immensely complex, with a zillion potential ways to make one wrong move that lead to complete disaster, it's easy to forget the myriad of details without a long checklist, and it's different every time — or goes obsolete, as has the space shuttle! Film just goes, while the shuttle program was cancelled back in 2011. So much for digital.

I love shooting film, and I'm learning new things every time I pick up the camera and press the shutter release. It’s photography as it’s meant to be.
