“Underscore” David Smith has put together all the Bond segments from The Talk Show:

> The James Bond movies are some of my favorite movies of all time. I remember very fondly following along with Dan and John each week as they made their way through the first twenty three films. Those conversations still stand as one of my favorite podcast series.

> In 2012 (just before Skyfall came out) I had the notion to go back and re-listen to them all. Unfortunately since they were done as a segment inside of regular Talk Show episodes it was initially a bit tricky to find them all. However, once I was able to isolate them the re-listen was worth it.

This compilation is a small treasure for all Bond fans out there. Much like David, I look back on those segments of The Talk Show with incredibly fond memories, and I'm really glad they're now even more accessible. I can't wait to re-listen to each one of them — with the obligatory movie re-watch, of course.
