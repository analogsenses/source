[Daring Fireball's WWDC 2011 Prelude](http://daringfireball.net/2011/06/wwdc_2011_prelude)


<blockquote>If I were to publish everything I know regarding tomorrow’s announcements, it would be a short and decidedly unsensational article. What I know are a handful of minor features at the edges. The big picture regarding iOS 5 and iCloud — and how the two interrelate — is an utter mystery to me. These things have been as well-kept secrets as any major projects from Apple in recent years.</blockquote>


John shares his thoughts prior to WWDC. Interesting read, my gut tells me that he will be right in pretty much everything he wrote.
