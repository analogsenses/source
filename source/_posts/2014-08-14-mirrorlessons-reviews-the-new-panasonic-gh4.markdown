[MirrorLessons reviews the new Panasonic GH4](http://www.bestmirrorlesscamerareviews.com/2014/08/13/the-complete-panasonic-gh4-review-chapter-one-still-photography/)

Looks like an interesting camera:



<blockquote>The Micro Four Thirds system has certainly reached its maturity in the last two years. The new Panasonic Lumix GH4 is the latest example of how advanced the system has become. I feel that this camera in particular is more important than any other MFT camera because it represents a great step not only in terms of stills but also video recording.</blockquote>



I'm not much of a video shooter, but 4K video at 30 fps is quite impressive.
