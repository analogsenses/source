Great piece by Alok Jha for _The Guardian_:

> Water breaks all the rules. Since the 19th century, chemists have developed a [robust framework to describe what liquids are](http://www.chemistryexplained.com/Kr-Ma/Liquids.html) and what they can do. Those ideas are almost useless at explaining the weird behaviour of water. Its strangeness underlies what happens every time you drop an ice cube into a drink. Think about it for a moment: in front of you is a solid, floating on its liquid. Solid wax doesn’t float on melted wax; solid butter doesn’t float on melted butter in a hot saucepan; rocks don’t float on lava when it spews out of a volcano.
