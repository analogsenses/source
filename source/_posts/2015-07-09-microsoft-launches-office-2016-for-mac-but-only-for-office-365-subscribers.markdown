Kirk Koenigsbauer, writing on Microsoft’s Office blog:

> Office 365 subscribers can get the newest version of Office for Mac today. All you need is an Office 365 subscription (Office 365 Home, Personal, Business, Business Premium, E3 or ProPlus), which includes the rights and access to use Office applications on Mac, Windows, iOS and Android devices, along with additional value in OneDrive and Skype.

Non-subscribers will have to wait until September to be able to purchase a standalone version of Microsoft’s productivity suite.

If you had any doubts that Microsoft is trying to drive their customers to the subscription-based model of Office as hard as they can, this should put them to rest once and for all.
