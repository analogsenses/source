This week’s _Tools & Toys_ review, by yours truly, touches on a topic near and dear to my heart: the bicycle. In many ways, this article is a love letter to the bicycle as much as it is a review of a bag:

> On bicycles, humans become the most efficient animals in the world. Whether you’re going for your daily commute or for a week-long adventure surrounded by nature, the bicycle is a great means of transportation that lets you easily move from point A to point B while staying in touch with your environment. Feeling the spring wind in your face as you pedal your way to your destination is one of the greatest pleasures of riding a bike.

> Don’t believe it? You need only watch a kid’s face whenever they ride. That invariable expression of pure, unadulterated joy is a tell-tale sign that the bicycle is something special.

English author H.G. Wells once said: “_Every time I see an adult on a bicycle, I no longer despair for the future of the human race”_. I couldn’t agree more.
