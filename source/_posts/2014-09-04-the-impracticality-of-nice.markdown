I love bicycles.


I believe they are one of the most remarkable inventions in human history and if I can, I ride one every day. And I don't mean in a lycra-clad kind of way, but as a normal person wearing everyday clothes. The bicycle is my usual means of transportation in Madrid. 

Bicycles thrive in the city, where the average trip is often just a couple km long. It's usually, by far, the most convenient way to move from point A to point B,[^1] without having to worry about things like finding a parking spot. It also happens to be really good for your health.

[^1]: This is what worldwide bicycle ambassador [Michael Colville](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mikael_Colville-Andersen) calls "A-to-B-ism".

Up until 2010 I had been using the same bicycle since I was 15 years old: an old [Kona Lava Dome from 1998](https://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/6182098088/). I love it. I've used the heck out of it for over 15 years and it's never let me down. It's still in pretty good shape, considering the abuse it has endured over the years. However, riding a mountain bike in the city, especially one like Madrid, is not ideal, so after a couple years of daily use I decided it was time for a change.[^2]

[^2]: For obvious sentimental reasons, I hesitate to call it an upgrade.

I also appreciate nice things. That's why I'm a Mac and iOS user, among other things. I value attention to detail and I recognize great design when I see it. When someone [sweats the details](https://shawnblanc.net/thedetails/), it shows. And I like that.

When it comes to sweating the details in the bicycle world, there's a name that's in a class of its own: [Bianchi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bianchi_Bicycles). They're the oldest bicycle manufacturer in the world. They've been making bicycles since 1885, almost 130 years ago, and they're a fundamental part of the history of the bicycle.

It should then come as no surprise that when I decided to buy my first nice bicycle, I chose a Bianchi: 

"Insert picture"

It's a beautiful chrome Bianchi Pista from 2010. It's the first bicycle that I purchased with my own money. Today I own four different bicycles,[^3] but the Pista remains the only one I have purchased new, in a store. It's gorgeous.

[^3]: Because, of course, I adhere to [Rule  No. 12](http://www.velominati.com/the-rules/#12).

The craftsmanship and attention to detail are evident everywhere you look. In the time I've had it, I've modified many of its components, but its essence remains intact: that beautiful, chromed piece of steel with Bianchi decals on it. The frame is the true soul of a bicycle, and mine's is a stunner.

It's also one hell of an experience. Fixed-gear bicycles are so much fun. I hadn't enjoyed myself so much riding a bicycle since I was 10 years old. I feel very fortunate to own it.

And yet, in the past 12 months, it's been mostly sitting on its rack at home. I have barely touched it, and it makes me sad. 

The reason for that is obvious: such a bicycle gets noticed. It gets looks, and comments from strangers. I do not feel confident leaving it chained to a post, no matter how good a lock I may have. And this severely impacts the usefulness of the bike. After all, it's supposed to be a vehicle, not some fancy item to show off.

And so, last year I decided to buy another bicycle. A "beater bike", as they say. The kind of bike you can leave out on the streets without worrying. The kind of bike no one would bother to steal, but even if someone did, you wouldn't really care that much. 

I found a used Peugeot from 1990 in pretty good shape and I bought it for roughly $80. That's almos 20 times cheaper than my Bianchi. And you know what? It may be the best purchase I've ever made.
