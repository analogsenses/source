Fantastic, in-depth article on the lessons Eric Kim learned by waiting a full year before developing his film:

> I often find that the longer I wait before I develop my film, the better I am able to self-edit my own photos. Not only that, but after a period of a few months of taking a photo, I forgot haven taken many photographs. Which means when I finally see the photographs a year after, I don’t remember shooting most of them.

> It is always easier to criticize and edit the work of other photographers (because you aren’t as emotionally attached). But when you forget about having taken your own photographs, it is almost like you are judging another photographer’s images.

Interesting approach. I don’t think I could wait for an entire year without seeing my photos, though. It may be OK for seasoned photographers but for beginners, I’m not so sure it’s a good approach. One year is a hell of a long time during which you’re left with no objective way to gauge your progress, and whether your instincts are right or wrong. Even worse, you may end up cultivating bad habits, simply because you lacked the necessary feedback to correct them in a timely manner.

As a thought experiment, I get it. I just don’t think it’s a viable choice for me, personally. That said, the article also provides an excellent look at the many joys of shooting film and for that alone, it’s well worth your time. 

Finally, I’d like to thank CJ Chilvers for recently [pointing me in Kim’s direction](https://twitter.com/cjchilvers/status/579015698808221696). I owe you one, sir.
