[Own your words | Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/own-your-words/)



<blockquote>I do have an issue with giving away your words just because itâ€™s easy to do so. By default, your words should be yours, and that means more than being attributed: it also means gathering them together in your own publication, controlled by you, that serves as a place for your own voice to be heard above and instead of all others.</blockquote>



Exactly.
