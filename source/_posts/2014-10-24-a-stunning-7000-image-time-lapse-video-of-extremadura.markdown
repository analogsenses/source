This is an amazing time-lapse video of the Extremadura region, in Spain:

> Hope you enjoy the scenery as spectacular as Ibores-Villuercas Geopark in CÃ¡ceres (Extremadura unknown), dry plains and beautiful Sierra de Fuentes, extensive irrigated areas of Vegas del Guadiana with these natural mirrors are rice fields , the imposing castle of Medellin with its imposing yet (and recently unearthed) Teatro Romano, the beautiful and ever present oaks, the beautiful sunsets and moon and sun, the Milky Way and, of course, a symbol of Extremadura: Storks.

Extremadura is a beautiful region, and its landscapes are incredibly diverse. It also happens to be where I was born, so take it from me: it's a sight to behold. Or better yet, watch the video and see for yourself.
