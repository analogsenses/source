What a hilarious — and strangely gorgeous — take on travel photography. I love it. 

As a side comment, that [Sigma 35mm f/1.4 lens](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A35X8ZG/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00A35X8ZG&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=JW7SFN6GKFCGSW3U) is an absolute beast. I'd love to get me one of those for my “new” Canon EOS 3 film camera.
