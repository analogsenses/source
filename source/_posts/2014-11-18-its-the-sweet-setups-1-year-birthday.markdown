Shawn Blanc:

> I’d like to think that a year in, and The Sweet Setup has now found a good groove. There are [5 of us behind the scenes](http://thesweetsetup.com/colophon/): Stephen Hackett, Jeff Abbott, Chris Gonzales, and Bradley Chambers, and we’ve found an editorial pace that works for us: one setup interview and a quick tip per week, and two app reviews per month.

An awesome team for an awesome website.

Happy birthday, guys.
