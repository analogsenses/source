Speaking of The Phoblographer, this is an excellent article:

> A year can change someone, especially if youâ€™re a goal-driven photographer always trying to make progress. Every year, each photographer tries to make changes that move them forward, but some do better than others.

> We talked [to] eight of the top photographers in the world about how they progressed and what they did that made a difference.

Great stories and advice in here, not to mention some truly gorgeous photographs.
