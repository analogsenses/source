I know it sounds like a clickbait headline, but it's actually a pretty cool article by Michelle Young for Untapped Cities. For example, did you know there's an apartment right on top of the tower?

> Within a year of the completion of the Eiffel Tower, it was reported by writer Henri Girard that Gustav Eiffel [was] “the object of general envy.” But it wasn’t for his engineering and design feat, it was for an apartment he had at the third-to-highest level of the Eiffel Tower. Girard wrote that the famous apartment was “furnished in the simple style dear to scientists.”

> Eiffel used mostly for meeting important guests like Thomas Edison, who visited in September 1889, rather than for debaucherous parties. [Here is a lovely essay](http://www.roomonethousand.com/eiffels-apartment-and-the-architecture-of-dreams/) on the apartment, describing how the apartment embodied many of the philosophical dreams of 19th century thinkers. Today it also contains mannequins of Eiffel and Edison.
