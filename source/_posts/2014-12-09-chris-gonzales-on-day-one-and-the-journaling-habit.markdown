I've always had a love/hate relationship with journaling, as in, I love the idea of it, but I just can't bring myself to actually _do_ it.

In this article, Chris Gonzales shares some great tips on how to get into the habit — not to mention _why_ — as well as a thoughtful review of one of the most popular digital journaling apps out there: Day One.

I really enjoyed this piece, and I think it's a fantastic aid for those of us who can never seem to get enough traction for it to stick.
