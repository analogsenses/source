Here's the statement from Apple:

>We wanted to provide an update to our investigation into the theft of photos of certain celebrities. When we learned of the theft, we were outraged and immediately mobilized Apple’s engineers to discover the source. Our customers’ privacy and security are of utmost importance to us. After more than 40 hours of investigation, we have discovered that certain celebrity accounts were compromised by a very targeted attack on user names, passwords and security questions, a practice that has become all too common on the Internet. None of the cases we have investigated has resulted from any breach in any of Apple’s systems including iCloud or Find my iPhone. We are continuing to work with law enforcement to help identify the criminals involved.

So, they're basically saying that their systems were not at fault, and that the attackers knew which iCloud accounts they were hacking into.

This strikes me as a very odd statement. Even if their systems were not breached, at the end of the day several high-profile accounts were hacked. Their wording makes it sound a lot like they're saying: "this is life on the Internet, better get used to it".

That's not very reassuring, and it doesn't sound like Apple to me.

If you haven't done it yet, this might be a good time to set up [2-step verification for your Apple ID](http://support.apple.com/kb/ht5570).
