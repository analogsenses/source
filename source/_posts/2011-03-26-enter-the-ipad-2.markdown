As of today, I'm the proud owner of a 32 GB, WiFi-only white iPad 2. If you don't get it on Day One, it doesn't count ;)

I have to admit that this is not the first time I've done something like this: I waited more than 6 hours in line to get my iPhone 3G, the first one that was sold in Spain, on July 11th 2008, Day One. I still use it as my one and only phone.

I didn't get the original iPad when it was released here, but after this year, I have realized that this is a revolution I want to be a part of.

And this time I only had to wait for 30 minutes... Great :)

Now let's get this party started!
