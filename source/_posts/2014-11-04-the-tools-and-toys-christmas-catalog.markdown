Shawn Blanc and the rest of the _Tools & Toys_ team have put together an excellent selection of articles for the _Tools & Toys_ Christmas Catalog. This is holiday shopping at its best:

> We at _Tools & Toys_ [don’t believe](http://toolsandtoys.net/editorials/on-mindfulness-and-quality/) we should buy stuff just for the sake of buying stuff. We believe gift-giving should genuinely benefit the recipient and increase the quality of their life. One way to do this is to give carefully-considered, quality items. We have done our best to make sure everything in our _Tools & Toys_ Gift Guide meets that standard.

I personally own several of the items in the catalog, and I can totally vouch for their quality. Really, really great stuff. Besides, they will be donating 10% of all affiliate earnings for the next two months to [St. Jude Children's Hospital](http://www.stjude.org/waystohelp), [Operation Christmas Child](http://www.samaritanspurse.org/donation-items/adopt-a-shoebox/) and [App Camp for Girls](http://appcamp4girls.com/contribute/):

> At _Tools & Toys_ we have always donated 10% of our gross income to charity.

That's a really classy move. If you were on the fence about any of those items, think no more.
