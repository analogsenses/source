Chris Wild, Mashable:

> In 1989, Michael Galinsky, then a 20-year-old student, took a month to traverse the U.S. Everywhere he went, he documented the same place: the shopping mall.  The results are now an archive of a vanished world, simultaneously familiar and foreign, trivial and full of meaning.

Aah, the eighties and their fashion. Gotta love'em.

Being European though, the whole concept of spending my time at the mall feels extremely alien to me. I've seen it on American TV shows and movies, but I've never quite been able to get it. 

To me, malls are like the dentist's office: you don't go there unless it's absolutely necessary and even then, you only stay for as little time as humanly possible.

Does that make me weird?
