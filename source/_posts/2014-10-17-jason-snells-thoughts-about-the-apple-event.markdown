Speaking of Jason Snell:

> Letâ€™s step through that one again. People will forsake their Mac Pros for this iMac, until there comes a day when a screen like this is available as an external display option for the Mac Pro. For $2500 or less. People who would never have considered buying an iMac will buy this iMac.

I have to say, I agree. I haven't even seen this iMac yet, and I already want it. [A few months ago](http://www.analogsenses.com/2014/05/21/upgrading-my-early-2008-24-imac-to-an-ssd/) I said I probably wouldn't replace my current iMac â€” a 24-inch Early 2008 model â€” until it died on me, but an iMac with a Retina display is a whole different animal.
