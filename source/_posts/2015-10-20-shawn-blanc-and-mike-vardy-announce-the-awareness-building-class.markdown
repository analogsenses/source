Exciting new project by Shawn Blanc and Mike Vardy:

> The Awareness Building Class is a 5-part series of audio teachings filled with real-life stories and actionable advice to help you stop guessing and start going.

Perfect description, although of course there’s much more to it than that. Follow the title link to check out everything that’s built into the class. Spoiler alert: it’s a lot.

Plus, as a nice added bonus, if you’ve already done [The Focus Course](https://thefocuscourse.com/) or sign up for it before October 26 (next Monday), you get the class for free.
