Angelica Asadi:

<blockquote>One of my favorite quotes is by the beautiful and talented comedian, Sarah Silverman, in her HBO special _We Are Miracles_. She says: “Stop telling girls they can be anything they want when they grow up. I think it’s a mistake, not because they can’t, but because it would’ve never occurred to them they couldn’t.”</blockquote>

_Exactly_. 

What a wonderful essay. It somehow got lost in my Instapaper queue a few days ago, but I'm so glad I revisited it.
