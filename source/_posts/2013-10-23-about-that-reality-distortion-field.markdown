Frank Shaw, Corporate Vice President of Communications at Microsoft, writing on The Official Microsoft Blog:



<blockquote>So, when I see Apple drop the price of their struggling, lightweight productivity apps, I donâ€™t see a shot across our bow, I see an attempt to play catch up.</blockquote>



In other news, the iPhone is just an attempt to play catch up to BlackBerry.

Why do they let these people write on the Internet? Don't they know anyone can actually read these posts? Someone at Microsoft needs to get their house in order, now.
