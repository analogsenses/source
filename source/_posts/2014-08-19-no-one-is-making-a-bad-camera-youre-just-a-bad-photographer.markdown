[No One is Making a Bad Camera, You're Just a Bad Photographer  | The Phoblographer](http://www.thephoblographer.com/2014/08/09/one-making-bad-camera-youre-just-bad-photographer/#.U_OKIBZxVER)

Chris Gampat:



<blockquote>If you want better pictures, just go out and get a camera and a lens and whatever you need to create the scene that you want. You know why? Because no one is making bad products anymore. In this stage of the global economy, no one can afford to screw up. So instead, go train yourself to be a better photographer.</blockquote>



Agreed.
