Jaw-dropping movie by Kalle Ljung. Via [Kottke](http://kottke.org/15/04/a-tour-of-antartica-by-drone):

> This movie was shot during our 20 days trip to Antarctica in December 2014 to January 2015.

> We started from Ushuaia in Argentina and went to Port Williams in Chile, rounded Cape Horn and crossed the Drake Passage towards the Melchior Islands in Antarctica. We spent 16 days in the Antarctic and got to experience the most amazing scenery and wildlife before we returned back to Ushuaia.
