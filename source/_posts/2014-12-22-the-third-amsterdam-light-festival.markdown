Amsterdam is a gorgeous city:

> This winter, Amsterdam has lit up once again for the Amsterdam Light Festival. This is the third edition of the winter light festival which, for more than fifty days, illuminates the historical center of Amsterdam with projections on historical buildings, installations on the street,in public parks and on water for a unique experience in the darkest months of the year.
