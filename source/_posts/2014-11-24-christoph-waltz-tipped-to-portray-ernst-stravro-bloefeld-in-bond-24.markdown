Great scoop by the Daily Mail:

> It’s been more than 30 years since James Bond faced evil Ernst Stavro Blofeld, his most feared adversary.

> But now the intimidating baddie – famous for his trademark white cat and for gruesomely disposing of his failing underlings – is back. Django Unchained star Christoph Waltz is tipped to play the evil genius in a new 007 movie which is due to begin shooting next month.

I so want this to be true. Christoph Waltz is a perfect casting choice for Blofeld, one of the most iconic villains in movie history. 

After 30 years of litigation, the rights to the Blofeld character once again belong to EON, the producers of the official Bond films. This is why they're now able to bring back not only Blofeld himself, but all of SPECTRE with him.

With Daniel Craig, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris and Ben Whishaw already confirmed to reprise their roles, Léa Seydoux being announced as the next Bond Girl, and now possibly Christoph Waltz as the legendary cat-loving villain, Bond 24 is shaping up to be a pretty exciting movie indeed.
