[Roger Federer qualifies for the ATP World Tour Finals for a record 13th consecutive year | ATP World Tour](http://www.atpworldtour.com/News/Tennis/2014/08/34/London-Finale-Federer-Qualifies.aspx)



<blockquote>The 33-year-old Swiss is the most successful player to compete at the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, compiling a 44-11 record and claiming a record six titles in 2003-04, 2006-07 and 2010-11. He breaks the record of consecutive years qualifying for the championship, a mark he previously shared with Ivan Lendl (1980-91).</blockquote>



Just another reason why this is a player for the ages.
