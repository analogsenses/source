The Lily Camera is a drone that will follow you shooting HD video while you do all sort of crazy things. On the specs side, the Lily is a pretty decent camera that can shoot 1080p video at 60 fps, 720p video at 120 fps and 12 MP stills, but its coolest feature is that you simply need to throw it in the air to start recording a new video.

I’m not really into drones — or even old-fashioned GoPros, for that matter — but even I have to admit it looks pretty awesome.
