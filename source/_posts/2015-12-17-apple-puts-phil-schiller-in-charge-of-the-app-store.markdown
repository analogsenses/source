Interesting news from Apple today. Jeff Williams, writing for _Ars Technica_:

> SVP of Worldwide Marketing Phil Schiler is now in charge of all App Stores across all of Apple’s platforms, which now include iOS, OS X, WatchOS, and tvOS.

> Schiller is taking over the App Store from Eddy Cue, who as Apple’s president of Internet Software and Services is still in charge of things like Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay, Siri, the apps formerly known as iWork and iLife, and other initiatives.

<del>On one hand, developer relations is under the App Store division, and Phil Schiller strikes me as a far better person to manage that than Eddy Cue ever was. On the other hand, everything else in the division has little to do with Schiller’s area of expertise, so I can’t help but wonder if he has what it takes to run it by himself.</del> **UPDATE:** Looks like I got this wrong. Developer relations has always been under Schiller, with the rest of the App Store management falling under Eddy Cue’s iTunes division. This shuffle brings everything App Store-related under Schiller’s supervision, which should help improve consistency and mitigate some of the issues that plague 3rd-party developers today. It’ll be interesting to watch what future changes, if any, Schiller introduces in the way Apple runs its various App Stores, that’s for sure.
