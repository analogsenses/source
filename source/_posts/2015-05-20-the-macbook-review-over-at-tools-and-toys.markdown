Awesome review by Nate Barham. I really like that his review is mostly not about the MacBook itself, but _why_ it makes sense, and why it needs to exist:

> It is a computer for _there_ rather than _here_ in that if you are always here, then Apple’s lineup likely contains a better machine for you: one that emphasizes power, or screen real estate, or a multitude of ports, or price. But the MacBook is not for _here_ — it is meant to be taken with you: to the bus stations, the parks, the coffee shops, the next-door offices, the weekend cabins and hotel rooms. When you go _there_, it is meant to go with you, and to hardly be noticed when you do.

And boy, are those pictures _gorgeous_.
