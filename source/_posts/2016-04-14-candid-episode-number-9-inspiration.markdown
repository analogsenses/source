This week’s episode of Candid was probably my favorite yet, despite my horrible cold-addled voice. Josh, Marius and yours truly dive into the always interesting topic of inspiration: what it is, where we look for it, and where we eventually find it.

We’re also announcing our second giveaway, thanks to the awesome people at Serif. We’re giving away two copies of their award-winning photo-editing Mac app, [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/photo/). This is a gorgeous app that is entirely Mac native, and it is so powerful and full-featured that it even gives Photoshop a run for its money.

If you want to win, all you need to do is follow the show’s Twitter account: [@Candid_FM](http://twitter.com/candid_fm). We’ll pick two winners at random and announce them next week. Good luck!
