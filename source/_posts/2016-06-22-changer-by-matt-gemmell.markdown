Matt Gemmell’s new novel, CHANGER, was released today. For those of us who are members on Matt’s personal site, this is a very special day. We’ve been walking alongside him right from day one, and we’ve watched with excitement and anticipation as he relentlessly inched closer and closer to the finish line. It’s been humbling to watch Matt deal with the struggle, all without ever losing faith in himself or his writing. Today, we all celebrate.

It’s been a great journey. Writing a book is no small deed — only the tree and the child missing now, I guess — and I for one feel very fortunate to have witnessed its birth from our tiny little window: Matt’s newsletter, _[The Writer’s Life](http://mattgemmell.com/membership/)_. 

Of course, the best part — you know, the actual reading — comes now. For what it’s worth, I’m only halfway through the first chapter and I’m already hooked. I’d say I’m surprised, but Matt always did have a way with words.

Now, if you’ll excuse me, I left a ruthless mercenary doing some pretty nasty things and I can’t wait to see what comes next.

Care to join me?
