Fantastic, brutal and completely honest piece by Josh Ginter on how — and more importantly, why — work has been keeping him away from _The Newsprint_ lately:

> Over the past few weeks, _work_ has equated to _progress_. Movement, in a forward direction. Acquisition of skills. Patience in acquiring those skills. And a work ethic I never thought I would _enjoy_.

> Progress is addicting. Growth is addicting. Accomplishing goals is addicting. My only regret is the amount of dust collecting on my camera.

Sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do and in those moments, the only way I’ve found to move forward is to keep your head down and keep pushing as hard as you can, for as long as it takes. And the thing about putting in the hours and working your ass off is, things usually get better a lot sooner than you thought they would.

Hang in there Josh, and don’t worry about your camera. It’ll be right there waiting for you — along with the rest of us.
