Well, that was unexpected: Apple today released the Apple Music app for Android. There’s no mention of this on [Apple’s PR page](http://www.apple.com/pr/), which adds a certain clandestine flair to the whole thing. Eddy Cue did tweet about it [a few minutes ago](https://twitter.com/cue/status/664156357956734976), though.

The app is labeled as beta, with several features missing or incomplete:

> * Music videos are coming soon.
> * Family membership sign-ups and upgrades require Mac or iOS.
> * Sign-up process to be optimized for Android.

Nothing too important missing here, but these omissions are worth keeping in mind anyway. Also, the way I understand the family membership situation is: you _can_ use the app with a family membership, you just can’t sign up for the membership or upgrade to it from within the app.
