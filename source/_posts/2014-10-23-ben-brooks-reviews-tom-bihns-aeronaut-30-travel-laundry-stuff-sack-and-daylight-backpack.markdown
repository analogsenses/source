I really enjoyed this review by Ben:

> The Aeronaut 30 is only 4 liters larger than the GR1, but those four liters make a world of difference. In fact, the Aeronaut 30 is the perfect travel bag for me, because it is the perfect size for the length of trips I normally take: 2-3 nights.

> I absolutely love the Aeronaut 30 and in my testing I found that it was well made, and well considered.

The GORUCK backpacks are awesome, but they must fit your travel preferences in order to be right for you. They're just extremely opinionated bags. Most of the time this is a good thing — great design is about making decisions — but sometimes it's not.

It's good to know there are other high-quality bags out there, for those occasions where you just need a different option. Ben does a terrific job of pointing out the strengths and weaknesses of each bag in a variety of situations. Great stuff.
