<blockquote>The evolution of the women’s swimsuit is one place where there has been a visible shift away from modesty. In the current world of swimwear, small is often beautiful and less is considered more desirable. But designer and actress Jessica Rey asks, “Who says it has to be itsy bitsy?” Rey argues that within the construct of modesty, there is a freedom—that modesty isnt about covering up whats bad, but about revealing dignity.</blockquote>

I found this to be an excellent, thought-provoking talk.
