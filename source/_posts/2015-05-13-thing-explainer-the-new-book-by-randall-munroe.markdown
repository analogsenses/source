Randall Munroe, writing on [the xkcd blog](http://blog.xkcd.com/2015/05/13/new-book-thing-explainer/):

> Today, I’m excited to announce that I’m [publishing a collection](http://xkcd.com/thing-explainer/) of large-format (9″x13″) Up Goer Five-style blueprints. The book is full of detailed diagrams of interesting objects, along with explanations of what all the parts are and how they work.

> The titles, labels, and descriptions are all written using only the thousand most common English words. Since this book explains things, I’ve called it _Thing Explainer_.

I love these schematic drawings. The book will be released before the end of the year, and I can’t wait to get my hands on it.
