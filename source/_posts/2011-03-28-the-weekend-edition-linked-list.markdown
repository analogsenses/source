Admittedly, I've been giggling over the iPad 2 like a little girl since [I got it on Friday](http://analogsenses.com/2011/03/25/enter-the-ipad-2/), which hasn't left me much time to write a decent post, or compile the hottest stories of the past two days. That is not to say that there weren't any stories, on the contrary: some of them were pretty good, and a couple were simply hilarious.

The problem with being a little late is that most of these stories have already been reported in many fine places all over the Web, so instead of sounding like broken record, I'm just going to point you towards them and let you see for yourself.

All right, let's do this!



	
  * First, there was [an Epic Color review](http://mike3k.posterous.com/best-app-store-review-ever) in the App Store. Just read it all the way through, it is worth it. Via [@gruber](https://twitter.com/gruber/status/52010186084327424).

	
  * Also, [The Macalope went nuts](http://www.macworld.com/article/158849/2011/03/macalope_noyes.html) over Katherine Hayes and her dislike [for tablets in general](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/223204/why_tablets_are_just_a_fad.html), and [the iPad 2 in particular](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/221306/why_the_ipad_2_leaves_me_cold.html). Via [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2011/03/26/macalope).

	
  * TechCrunch reported that [iOS 5 will be delayed](http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/26/ios-5-likely-pushed-to-the-fall-after-a-cloud-unveiling-at-wwdc/), possibly until Fall, and probably in the September iPod event. They claim that the iPhone 5 will debut in June as expected, but no iOS5 goodness just yet.

	
  * Marco Arment broke down [the numbers of Instapaper usage](http://www.marco.org/4073734086) across devices and iOS versions. Turns out pretty much everyone is running on new hardware, and at least iOS 4.

	
  * A 14-year-old (!) named J-P Teti absolutely nailed [why the iPad is massively misunderstood](http://jpteti.com/post/4072771125/the-ipad-is-99-more-open-than-any-other-computer) by its competitors. Turns out there are more regular people than geeks out there. Via [Minimal Mac](http://minimalmac.com/post/4076312420/j-p-teti-the-ipad-is-99-more-open-than-any-other).

	
  * To stay with the youth theme, there was another teenager, this time a 15-year-old (I know, it seems way too old after the last story) who [explained the Average Selling Price](http://mattrichman.tumblr.com/post/4076905315/blackberry-asp-in-q4-2011) (ASP) of RIM's Blackberry devices. RIM hasn't reported these numbers since last quarter and, surprise surprise, everything indicates that's because the numbers are going down. In a hurry. RIM is in trouble. Via [@asymco](https://twitter.com/asymco/status/51232234962821121).

	
  * Finally, Mashable reported that GoogleÂ [is not ready to release Honeycomb's source code](http://mashable.com/2011/03/24/honeycomb-delay/) just yet. This flies right in the face of the "open" philosophy that Google likes to brag about. Looks like it's not so easy to maintain a platform when everyone is free to tinker with it. They say it will be released eventually, just like Adobe says Flash is going to run smoothly on mobile devices, like, tomorrow. Call me a cynic, but it seems to me that tomorrow never actually becomes today.


And that was pretty much it over the weekend. I will leave you with a note regarding my first impressions of the iPad 2:

You know how it is when you have a brand new device: you just can't stop playing with it, installing apps, configuring it, arranging it so that it is exactly right. Well, after a weekend of Geek Abuse (TM), the iPad 2 managed to get through to Sunday night and still have an impressive 15% battery life remaining. I had to plug it occasionally in order to sync it, but never for more than 5 minutes at a time.

That's big.

Now have a good one! Cheers!
