Dear readers,

It's that time of the year again. For a few precious days, we get to step away from our glowing screens and look in the eyes of family and friends instead. Please, be sure to make the most of them and don't worry, the Internet will wait. I promise.

Happy holidays, and thank you for reading. Now go grab those marshmallows.
