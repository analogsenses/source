I’ve just updated my guide to the best Full Frame E-mount lenses to account for the state of the system as of October 2016, including the — admittedly few — announcements we saw at Photokina. 

Now, this guide isn’t and was never meant to be a comprehensive list of every FE lens in existence. Only the very best lenses, those that can be considered great long-term investments, are featured. As a result, only one new lens makes the cut in this update: the **[Zeiss Loxia 85mm f/2.4 Sonnar T\*](/2016/01/13/gear-guide-the-best-full-frame-lenses-for-the-sony-e-mount/#zeiss-loxia)**.
