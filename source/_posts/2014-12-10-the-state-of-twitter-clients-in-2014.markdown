Just when you thought you were about to catch up to your Instapaper queue, Federico Viticci goes all Siracusa on us to analyze the three most popular Twitter clients for iOS: Tweetbot, Twiterrific and Twitter.

This amazingly detailed review is well over 20,000 words long. It would totally make sense as a standalone Kindle book.

Way to go, Federico. What an awesome piece of work.
