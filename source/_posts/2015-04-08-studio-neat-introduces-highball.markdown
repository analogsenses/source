Super-cool new iPhone app for collecting and sharing cocktail recipes:

> Additionally, we wanted to create an easy way to share recipes. When you stumble upon something tasty, the inclination is to share it. There were many paths we could have gone down in regards to sharing, but we took the simple one, with a twist. When you share a recipe, the app generates an image of a “recipe card,” which is super easy to share on Twitter or iMessage or email or whatever. The image is 16x9, orientated in portrait, so it is designed to look great on mobile. 

Having been designed by Studio Neat, Highball is not only clever and useful, it’s gorgeous to look at, too. And don’t miss the accompanying [Sandwich video](https://vimeo.com/123639045).
