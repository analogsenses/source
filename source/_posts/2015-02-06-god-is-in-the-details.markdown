Buzz Usborne, founder of [Prevue](https://prevue.it/), writes a mind-numbingly thorough article on the importance of details in design:

> But let’s be honest; using a product over-and-over, re-building functionality, and obsessing about the little things takes a _lot_ of time — perhaps a luxury afforded to side-projects like Prevue, or products with too much money. They’re usually too hard to justify, and they’re definitely the first thing to be sacrificed when push comes to shove. That’s probably why Ludwig Mies van der Rohe only designed a handful of buildings that weren’t ugly skyscrapers — or why Prevue doesn’t ship features very often.

> Having spent the last 7 years polishing my own side-project, I’ve learned where to look for “quick wins” when it comes to building detail-oriented design into larger, fast-moving commercial products. So instead of professing to knowing the perfect solution for forcing “detail-mining” into your release schedule, I thought I’d share a few places where you can start looking for improvement in your own projects, and why those details can make all the difference.

I came across this piece via my friend [Chris Gonzales](http://www.sparkjournal.net/journal/2015/2/god-is-in-the-details) just when I was about to go to bed, and now I blame him for my insomnia.
