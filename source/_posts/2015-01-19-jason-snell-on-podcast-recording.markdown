Excellent and very informative article by Jason Snell:

> While I think it’s true that many people underestimate how much work goes into making a podcast, I also get the sense that other people overestimate the time I spend. And depending on what kind of a podcast you’re creating, the amount of time required to put it together can vary widely. The average episode of [The Incomparable](http://theincomparable.com/theincomparable/) probably takes three or four hours to edit; the average [TV Talk Machine](http://theincomparable.com/tvtm) I can turn around in 10 minutes.
