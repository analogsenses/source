Today's xkcd:

[![iOS 8 Keyboard on xkcd](http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/ios_keyboard.png)](http://xkcd.com/1427/)

I'm so happy I got the 4th movie reference, because in what's an amazing coincidence, yesterday I watched [Serenity](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0379786/) for the first time ever.

It's actually kinda creepy how xkcd seems to do that to me every now and then.
