Speaking of bicycle culture by design, Mikael Colville-Andersen tells us the story of Ole Kassow and his wonderful [Cycling Without Age](http://cyclingwithoutage.org) project:

> Watch this TED x talk. It is inspiring. It is moving. It is important. Watch it and share it.

> Not just because it's about bikes but because it is about caring for our elderly, rebuilding a volunteer-minded society and it is about how individuals with passion and vision can change things. Change things quickly, effectively and massively.

> I know this individual. I work three metres from him every day. Ole Kassow is his name.
