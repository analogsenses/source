Fascinating story by Christine Dell'Amore for National Geographic, on how conservators of the [Antarctic Heritage Trust](http://www.nzaht.org) restored four portable wooden huts to their original 1917 condition:

> The buildings include Shackleton's 33-foot-long (10-meter-long) Nimrod hut on Cape Royds, where workers unearthed a stash of whiskey [sic] and brandy, libations that fortified the men during the 1907 Nimrod expedition. Another, the Terra Nova hut on Cape Evans, was the largest Antarctic building of its time at 50 feet (15 meters) long. It [contained a never-before-seen handwritten notebook of George Murray Levick](https://www.nzaht.org/AHT/Levicks-notebook/), a member of Scott's 1910-13 Terra Nova expedition.

Well, obviously. How somebody could survive in the South Pole without a steady supply of whisky is, frankly, beyond me.
