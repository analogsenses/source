A couple of weeks ago I mentioned how I was thinking about making some changes to the current format of my Morning Coffee articles. One such change included the possibility to offer it as an email newsletter instead of, or alongside the current version. 

I’m still thinking about the best way to implement that but in the meantime, if you want your Morning Coffee to be delivered right to your inbox every week, I have some great news. Friend of the site [Pedro Meireles](https://twitter.com/pedroameireles) has generously written and published an awesome [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com) (if this, then that) recipe that allows you to do just that:

> Every Saturday morning Álvaro Serrano publishes his weekly post titled “Morning Coffee”. With this recipe you will receive it on your e-mail the minute it is published. Great way to start the weekend reading!

This is so cool. My most sincere thanks to Pedro for sharing this!
