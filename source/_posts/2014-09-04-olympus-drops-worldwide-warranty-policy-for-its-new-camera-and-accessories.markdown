Speaking of Olympus:

> Donâ€™t go doing anything too dangerous with that new Pen E-PL7 as the company has just announced it will stop adding worldwide warranty support for its new digital cameras and accessories. While every piece of Olympus camera equipment has come with a worldwide warranty card since April 2014, now these globetrotting service packages will be reserved for a smaller set of products.

If you were thinking of buying a new Olympus camera or lens overseas to save money, you may want to reconsider.

At least worldwide warranties for equipment purchased before September 2014 will still be honored.
