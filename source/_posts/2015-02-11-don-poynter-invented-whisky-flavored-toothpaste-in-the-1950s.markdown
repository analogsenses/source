Messy Nessy:

> In 1954, Don secured a $10,000 bank loan and began manufacturing the best damn reason to brush your teeth twice a day.

> The toothpaste was available in Bourbon and Scotch flavours and contained 3% alchohol. The product gained enough buzz that LIFE magazine did a story on it and Poynterâ€™s invention became a popular novelty product across the country in the 1950s. The idea was later copied by several other brands and Poynter ceased production soon after.

There goes another one of my ideas to become a millionaire. And they say we live in an advanced society.
