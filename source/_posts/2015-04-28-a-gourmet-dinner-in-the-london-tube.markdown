Messy Nessy:

> It doesn’t hurt that the Basement Galley’s [Underground Supper Club](http://www.basementgalley.com/) is run by a Cordon Bleu chef either. Paris-trained Alex Cooper and his business partner mastermind Tom Fothergill, started out hosting small dinners Brixton flat but “upgraded” for a slightly more unique setting two years ago when they stumbled across a decommissioned 1967 London tube carriage on a filming location website.

> In a tiny disused café on a former Victorian waste pumping station where Alex produces his gourmet four-course meals and sends them out to the old underground carriage decked out in white table cloths and fine silverware, surrounded by other disused relics of London transport on the lot, an unlikely Underground Supper Club was born.

Any place is fine for dinner as long as there’s enough wine, I suppose.
