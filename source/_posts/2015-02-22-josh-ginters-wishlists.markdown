Josh Ginter:

> For all my materialistic habits, these lists act as a map for my life. From my hobbies, to my family, to my career, and to my spirituality, my wishlists deeply reflect who I am and what I want.

> I don’t think keeping wishlists is so bad. I don’t think _the kind_ of wishlist matters either. Write it down. Get it on paper. And use the lists as guides to find meaning in the mundanity of everyday life.

Solid approach. This is an area I need to get better at, and I really appreciate Josh being generous enough to share his own personal choices as an example.
