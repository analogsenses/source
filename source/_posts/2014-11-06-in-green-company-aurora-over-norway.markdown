> **Explanation:** Raise your arms if you see an aurora. With those instructions, two nights went by with, well, clouds -- mostly. On the third night of returning to same peaks, though, the sky not only cleared up but lit up with a [spectacular auroral display](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/ap140714.html). Arms went high in the air, patience and experience paid off, and the amazing [featured image](https://www.flickr.com/photos/apojapo/13297070714/) was captured.

Wow.

This is easily one of the most incredible pictures I've ever seen. I believe I just found my next iPad wallpaper.
