With the first deliveries of Apple Watch taking place towards the end of last week, it was Apple Watch weekend all over the Internet. Out of the _many_ people who posted their initial thoughts, I particularly enjoyed Jason Snell’s take:

> This is a new product. Like, a _really_ new product. It’s not like any product I’ve used before, though it has echoes of my old Pebble and of iOS devices, of course. But my built-up skills in using iOS were no use to me when I started using the Apple Watch. This is not a tiny iPhone on my wrist. This is something new.

> It might be good. It’s certainly impressive. But it’s new, and it’s going to take some time to figure out quite what it all means.

I think this is what confuses people the most about Apple Watch. We don’t yet have a way to judge it because it’s so unlike any other product before it — let alone any other Apple product.

Apple Watch will continue to confuse _many_ people, irk quite a few, and hopefully amaze the rest. It may well be the next big thing, but it’s still too soon to tell.
