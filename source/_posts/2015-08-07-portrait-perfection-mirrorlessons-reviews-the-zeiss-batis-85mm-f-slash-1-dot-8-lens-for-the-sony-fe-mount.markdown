Loved this review by Mathieu and Heather from MirrorLessons. According to many reviewers, the [Zeiss Batis 85mm f/1.8](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1140833-REG/zeiss_2103_751_85mm_f_1_8_batis_short.html) lens may well be the second-best 85mm lens ever made in terms of optical quality, second only to the ultimate manual focus beast, the [Zeiss Otus 85mm f/1.4](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00NGEE4O0/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00NGEE4O0&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=XOFPSUY6STZYRJ6C). Then again, the Otus is $4,400, so I suppose that’s to be expected.

Check out the video part of the review to get a taste for what you’ll find in it:

Both of the recently announced Zeiss Batis lenses look fantastic, but the 85mm is the one that seems most appealing to me, by far. There’s something about this lens that reminds me of the [Leica Nocticron](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HXE4GZQ/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00HXE4GZQ&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=ZBVQWOKGI5JIWIAT) lens for Micro Four Thirds. Both seem to take build and image quality to a whole new level inside their respective systems, and both seem to just be incredible portrait lenses.

The Zeiss Batis lenses still haven’t shipped in volume, so grabbing one will continue to be difficult for now. If you can get ahold of one, tough, it looks like you’re in for a treat.
