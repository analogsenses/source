description: "Unlike camera bodies, lenses are long-term investments. Choose wisely."
---

A couple years ago, Sony surprised the photography world with the Sony a7 camera, a remarkable mirrorless camera with a top of the line Full Frame sensor. In this second-generation of a7 bodies, features like in-body image stabilization (IBIS), better EVFs and more robust bodies are now standard across all models, and as a result, more and more photographers are flocking over to the Sony system. With the release of the universally praised Sony a7R II camera in 2015, as well as the other members of the a7-series of cameras, the Sony E-mount is arguably the hottest platform in photography right now.

As great as Sony's camera bodies are, however, the true value of a camera system is measured by its lenses. By that measure, the Full Frame E-mount system is still in its infancy, but in little over two years, Sony has done a remarkable job of covering the most important bases.

##Wide angle lenses

For the purpose of this guide, wide angle lenses are those with focal length shorter than 35mm. Those wider than 24mm would be considered ultra-wide angle lenses, but as of January 2016 there are no true ultra-wide angle lenses for the FE system, other than the 16-35mm f/4 lens, which is included in the zoom lens category.

###[Zeiss Batis 25mm f/2](http://amzn.to/1neY7iZ)

The Batis family of lenses was announced by Zeiss last year. They are designed and built by Zeiss, but unlike the lenses Zeiss makes for Canon, Nikon and others, the Batis are fully native E-mount lenses with autofocus, weather sealing, a cool and useful new OLED display that displays the depth of field scale, and a solid metal design. They also pack some serious image quality, as we've come to expect from the German manufacturer.

The Batis 25mm f/2 is the wider of the two lenses in the family, and also the most expensive. At $1,350, it is clearly intended to be a top-notch optical tool for landscape photographers, and the first few reviews all appear to agree on that. This lens uses a tried-and-true Distagon design, as well as Zeiss' own T* multi-coating to reduce flare, making it an excellent performer for a wide range of applications.

Unfortunately, Zeiss is still having trouble manufacturing the Batis lenses in sufficient quantities due to the overwhelming demand, so buying it online can be difficult — unless you're willing to overpay for it by a few good hundred dollars. Likewise, finding one in your local dealer might be a matter of luck, but if you do manage to snatch one, you're in for a treat.

##Standard lenses

The barrier between the wide angle and standard focal lengths is somewhat open to interpretation. For some people, wide angle lenses go up to 35mm inclusive, with 50mm being the first true standard focal length. Others, however, think 35mm is already long enough to be considered standard. Although this is purely a personal preference, this guide considers 35mm lenses to be part of the standard range.

###Sony Zeiss Distagon 35 f/1.4

35mm is perhaps the most versatile focal length. From street photography, photo-journalism, environmental portraits and even the occasional landscape shot, most everyday scenes look just right through a 35mm lens. And at f/1.4, there's plenty of control over depth of field — can you say _bokeh_? — as well as enough speed for low light photography. It will come as no surprise, then, that 35mm f/1.4 lenses are a staple of every Full Frame camera system out there.

The Sony Zeiss FE 35mm f/1.4 Distagon is the first such lens for the Full Frame E-mount system, and what a lens it is. Designed as a collaboration between the two companies, it is manufactured by Sony up to Zeiss specifications, and it's currently the fastest 1st-party lens for the E-mount system. 

On the technical front, the lens features a Distagon design with 12 elements in 8 groups and 9 rounded aperture blades. These two design treats give it a superior bokeh when compared to similar lenses for other systems. Sharpness is excellent across the frame right from f/1.4, and the lens becomes razor-sharp when stopped down a bit, even in the extreme corners. It also uses Zeiss' T* coating, and has weather sealing.

Besides its speed, the 35mm Distagon is also unique in that it features a switch that changes the clicky-ness of the aperture ring: with just a simple flick you can choose between having nice and reassuring clicks every 1/3rd of a stop, and having a completely click-less aperture ring that is smooth and silent, and therefore better suited for video recording.

Finally, the 35mm Distagon is a rather big and heavy lens, especially for a mirrorless system, but its optical performance more than makes up for the increase in size and weight. If you value lenses as long-term investments, you'll be absolutely delighted by this one.

##A brief aside on the Sony Zeiss 24-70 f/4 lens
Good, not great, and about to be replaced with a faster f/2.8 version according to several rumor sites.

##Rumors of upcoming lenses
Faster f/1.4 primes, affordable primes, the long awaited 85mm f/1.4 and 24-70 f/2.8... with so much movement and the system being so in flux at the moment, it only makes sense to invest in lenses that you know are top-notch. Luckily, there are plenty of options to choose from.

##Final Words
Invest in top-of-the-line glass and never look back.
