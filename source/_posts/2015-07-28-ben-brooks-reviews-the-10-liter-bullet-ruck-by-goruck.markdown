The 10 and 15-liter [Bullet Rucks](http://www.goruck.com/bullet-rucks/c/4?utm_source=goruck_affiliate&utm_medium=cpa&utm_content=8%25+on+GORUCK+Site&utm_campaign=1411Brooks+Review%2C+LLC) are smaller than GORUCK’s [Original Rucks](http://www.goruck.com/original-rucks/c/3?utm_source=goruck_affiliate&utm_medium=cpa&utm_content=8%25+on+GORUCK+Site&utm_campaign=1411Brooks+Review%2C+LLC), and do not have a padded laptop compartment. That makes them more suited for those times when you only want to carry your essential gear with you.

With that in mind, perhaps the most peculiar thing about the 10-liter Bullet Ruck is the fact that it can house the new MacBook in the hydration compartment, padded sleeve and all:

> In the hydration area of the bag I slide in a Tom Bihn vertical Cache — this is super padded and sized for my MacBook. It fits into the hydration section very snug, and allows you to pull out just the MacBook without having to hold down the protective sleeve. This works great for moving from place to place.

I love my GR Echo and in my opinion it’s the perfect size for an everyday backpack. Since I need to carry a 13-inch MacBook Pro, the 10-liter Bullet Ruck is not really a viable everyday choice for me. The problem with the Echo is that there are times when it’s decidedly too big for my taste, like when traveling with a GR2 as my sole carry-on bag.

The GR2 works great as a travel bag, but it’s too big and heavy to use as a daypack during the trip. I usually I sneak in a smaller bag inside the GR2 for that, but since I don’t usually take my laptop with me on day walks when I’m on a trip, even the Echo is overkill on those occasions.

For my everyday life in the city, I’ll take the Echo over any other bag, hands down. That said, this 10-liter Bullet Ruck could very well be the perfect size for my traveling needs, and the perfect companion for my GR2 when I’m on the road. As ever, your mileage may vary.
