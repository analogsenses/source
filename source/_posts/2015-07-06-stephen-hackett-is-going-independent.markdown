Great news from Stephen Hackett over at _512 Pixels_:

> Starting at the end of this month, I’ll be working from home, recording and editing podcasts, writing here and elsewhere, including [The Sweet Setup](http://thesweetsetup.com/) and monthly at [iMore](http://imore.com/). 512 Pixels took the back burner when we founded Relay last year, and I’m looking forward to giving it some much-needed attention.

Massive congratulations and best of luck, Stephen. I can’t wait to see what you have in store for us.
