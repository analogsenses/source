John has taken a few days to think about the Apple Watch, and these are his conclusions. I like how he looks at the entry-model, the $349 Sport edition, as the modern incarnation of an iPod. That actually makes a lot of sense, and contrary to what I thought, it looks like the watch will support it:

> It has internal storage and Bluetooth, so you’ll be able to use it for music playback _without_ taking your iPhone with you. With just your Apple Watch and Bluetooth earbuds you’ll be able to listen to music (and make Apple Pay purchases). I’d probably pay $349 just for that, using the Sport edition as a modern day iPod. Even better, though, I strongly suspect that WatchKit will allow for something like a native version of [Overcast](https://overcast.fm/) — syncing while within Bluetooth range of your iPhone, but working entirely independently as a podcast player, using the watch’s internal storage, when you’re out of range. A version of Vesper where you can dictate new notes on the fly? Now you’ve got something I’d pay at least $349 for in a heartbeat.

If that usage pattern is possible, I could easily see myself buying one. The Overcast example is genius, I think. I just hope Marco is listening.
