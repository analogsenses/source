Great piece by Christopher Clarey over at _The New York Times_:

> Michael Phelps and Bolt have been an Olympic one-two punch since 2008 in Beijing, where Bolt emerged to tear up the track while Phelps was already an absolute ruler in the pool.

> On Saturday they will overlap briefly once more, with Phelps, now 31, finishing up one of the most remarkable meets of his career, and with Bolt, fast approaching 30, launching his meet with the first round of the 100 meters.

What a generation of athletes. In case it wasn’t obvious, you’ll find me glued to my television both tonight and tomorrow night. If you’re coming over, please bring some cold beverages.
