Dear reader,

I want to take a minute to thank you for being there another year — and boy, what a year it’s been. I wish you nothing but the best for this holiday season, and I hope you have a chance to spend some quality time with your loved ones over the next few days.

For my part, I will also be taking a much-needed break. There’s some really cool stuff in the pipeline that I can’t wait to share with you early next year, but for now it is time to rest, and to recharge my batteries. Before I sign off, though, I have something to ask of you.

Times like these we take for granted all too easily, but trust me when I tell you, they are precious. One can never have too many opportunities to show our love to the people we care about. Please, make it a point to do just that this holiday season. Forget about this crazy Internet family of ours for a little while, and pay some more attention to them instead.

Don’t worry, we will all still be here when you get back. I promise.

Oh, and one last thing: happy holidays!

Love,  
Álvaro.
