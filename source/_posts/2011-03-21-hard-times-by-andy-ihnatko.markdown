Andy Ihnatko's next Big Hit, completely recorded and edited using GarageBand on an iPad 2.

Impressive. So much for the iPad being only a consumption device. And Ihnatko can sing. Also, don't forget to read through [his excellent, epic review](http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/4396870-452/review-ipad-2-is-not-revolutionary---but-it-is-great.html) of the iPad 2 for the Chicago Sun-Times. It even ends with a Conan The Barbarian reference.
