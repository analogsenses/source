[Gary Rides Bikes](http://garyridesbikes.blogspot.com.es/)

Meet Gary, and listen to his story: the chronicles of a cyclist living in the busy roads of LA. Great blog with some wonderful stories, such as [this classic passage](http://garyridesbikes.blogspot.com.es/2012/06/with-all-their-speed-forward-they-may.html) about cars from the Orson Welles film, ["The Magnificent Ambersons"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035015/) (1942):



<blockquote>"With all their speed forward they may be a step backward in civilization."</blockquote>
