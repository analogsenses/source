Excellent take on the Apple watch by Benjamin Clymer:

> But what makes the millions of us that would never trade a Rolex in for an Apple is the emotion brought about by our watches â€“ the fact that they are so timeless, so lasting, so personal. Nothing digital, no matter if Jony Ive (or Marc Newson) designed it, could ever replace that, if for no other reason than sheer life-cycle limitations. My watches will last for generations, this Apple Watch will last for five years, if we're lucky. On an emotional level, you can't compare them, and that is why I don't believe many serious watch lovers (who, again, would normally be racing to spend their cash on an Apple release) will go for this. It's directly competing for the same real estate, where as if we had seen a bracelet of some kind announced yesterday, those early adapters, myself included, would be begging Apple to take their pre-pre-pre-order (truth be told, I'll obviously be buying one, but you know what I'm saying).

That's _exactly_ how I feel about the Apple Watch, although of course Clymer puts it so much more eloquently. Great, great article.
