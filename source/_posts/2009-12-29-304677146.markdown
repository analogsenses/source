Here's some wishful thinking.  
  
- Listen to new music  
- Go to more concerts  
- Write more about the things that I care about  
- Say "I love you" when I mean it, even if it sounds gay  
- Say "I'm sorry" before it's too late  
- Be original  
- Eliminate the clutter in my life  
- Let go of the past and start something from scratch  
- Travel somewhere nice  
- Do something I feel passionate about  
- Show my true colors even if it gets me in trouble  
- Appreciate the little things more  
- Do something of Value  
- Accept my mistakes and learn from them  
- Make as many mistakes as I possibly can  
.  
.  
.  
  
- Repeat again next year.





Happy Holidays.
