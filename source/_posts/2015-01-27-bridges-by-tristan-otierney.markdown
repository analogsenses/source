What an incredible collection of images by Tristan O’Tierney. Mesmerizing.

I was not familiar with O’Tierney’s work but boy, the man can shoot. Check out [his storehouse post](https://www.storehouse.co/stories/x44s-time-flies) on the intricacies of long-exposure photography, for example. So great — and pretty instructive, too!

Via [Josh Ginter](http://thenewsprint.co/2015/01/27/tristan-otierneys-bridges/), who keeps adding fuel to my photographic addiction. I think I need an intervention.
