Vashi Nedomansky:

> [Raiders of the Lost Ark](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082971/) is a glorious obsession of mine. I have watched it close to 100 times and always glean a new detail or filmmaking tidbit on each viewing. As a child I looked up to Indy, now as a filmmaker I look up to Spielberg. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a masterpiece that fires on all cylinders with equal parts: adventure, comedy, action, thriller, love story and the supernatural. **I’ve scoured the internet for rare content and also created my own video essays in order to assemble this ’1-Page Film School’.**

Amazing.
