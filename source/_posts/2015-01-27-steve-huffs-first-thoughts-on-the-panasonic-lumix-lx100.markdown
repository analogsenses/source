Steve Huff:

> At the end of the day the LX100 did not inspire me enough to want to really get out there and shoot with it. I wish I could have tested the Leica version because while it is the same camera, it is made in a  different factory to higher standards and includes better extras (warranty, accessories, software) while looking nicer.

The entire review could be summarized in one word: meh. The LX100 is a decent camera but at that price, you can do better.
