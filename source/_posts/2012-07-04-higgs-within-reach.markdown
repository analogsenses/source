<blockquote>Our understanding of the universe is about to changeâ€¦</blockquote>



Massive news today from the folks over at CERN. The search for the infamous [Higgs boson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) may finally be over. It's impossible to overstate the importance of this discovery.

Our species takes another baby step out of the darkness. For all of us who are part of the scientific community, today is a great day.
