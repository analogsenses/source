There are so many excellent TV shows out there these days that it’s virtually impossible to keep track of everything. I don’t know about you, but the way I manage is by selecting a few shows — no more than five — to watch as they air, and leaving the rest for later binge-watching.

That usually works well for me, but if there’s something I hate is spending a few weekends binge-watching a show and getting really into it, only to find out it was canceled later.[^TV1]

[^TV1]: _[Dracula](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2296682/)_, I’m looking at you.

So, if you were wondering, this might be a good time to start watching [Marvel’s _Agent Carter_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3475734/), and a _really_ bad time to start watching [_Forever_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3487382/). 

And yes, I chose wrong both times.
