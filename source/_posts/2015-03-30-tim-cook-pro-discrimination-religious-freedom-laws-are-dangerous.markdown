Tim Cook, writing on The Washington Post:

> Legislation being considered in Texas would strip the salaries and pensions of clerks who issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples — even if the Supreme Court strikes down Texas’ marriage ban later this year. In total, there are nearly 100 bills designed to enshrine discrimination in state law.

> These bills rationalize injustice by pretending to defend something many of us hold dear. They go against the very principles our nation was founded on, and they have the potential to undo decades of progress toward greater equality.

It takes courage to speak up like this. Even more so when you're CEO of the most valuable company in the world.

Say what you will about Tim Cook’s leadership of Apple but one thing is clear: he does not shy away from a fight.
