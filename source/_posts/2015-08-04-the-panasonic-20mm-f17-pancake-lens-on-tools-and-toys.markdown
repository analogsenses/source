My review of the excellent Panasonic 20mm f/1.7 II APSH pancake lens for the Micro Four Thirds system — which happens to be [on sale right now on Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DJS830Y/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00DJS830Y&linkCode=as2&tag=analogsens-20&linkId=NSCCRSOJQ5LTULLN) — was published today on _Tools & Toys_.

This is one of my favorite lenses and, as much as I've tried in the past to convince myself that I've outgrown it, I always seem to come back to it. The image quality out of this lens is really incredible, especially when taking into account its diminutive size.

However, not everything about it is beyond reproach. Slow autofocus — especially by today's standards — mediocre manual focus implementation, and banding at high ISO settings are certainly non-trivial issues that may turn out to be deal breakers for some. For most people, though, the Panasonic 20mm is definitely a keeper.
