Steve Huff got his hands on an advanced prototype of the next lens in the Loxia lineup:

> When the 21 f.2.8 arrived I loved it for its small size and quality Loxia build. Feels the same as the other two in the Loxia line and that is a good thing as these lenses are built very well, even including a rubber seal around the mount to avoid dust getting in. The Loxia line of lenses from Zeiss are just what the doctor ordered for most of us who love a manual shooting experience with small high quality lenses.

The images are gorgeous. No word on pricing or release date on this piece, but the lens is already available for preorder [at B&H](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1189220-REG/zeiss_2131_999_loxia_21mm_f_2_8_lens.html) for $1,499, with an estimated availability date of mid December 2015.

Iâ€™m still not sold on the Loxia lenses for the most part, but I have to admit this does seem to be a fine piece of glass. Then again, $1,499 sounds quite steep for a lens like this.
