Mikael Colville-Andersen, worldwide bicycle ambassador and founder of Copenhagenize Design:

> I have always been fascinated by how the bicycle has muscled its way into various languages. There are numerous bicycle references in Danish that are used by reflex, without any direct reference to a bicycle anecdote. I started wondering if this is the case in other languages and have scribbled notes down based on conversations with colleagues and friends.

This is awesome. Here's to adding many more references to this list in the future.
