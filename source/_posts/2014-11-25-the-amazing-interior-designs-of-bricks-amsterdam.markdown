BRICKS Amsterdam is an Amsterdam-based interior design studio created by James van der Velden. They have some incredible projects, including [this stunning industrial loft](http://www.bricksamsterdam.com/project/garage-loft-amsterdam/) that they created in what used to be an old garage:

Also, check out [this other loft](http://www.bricksamsterdam.com/project/loft-amsterdam/), comparing before and after pictures. It's just as impressive, if not more.

I love how some talented designers can truly transform a space beyond recognition. It's an incredible skill that requires a unique blend of really good taste, impeccable craft and a very vivid imagination.
