Stephanie Mlot, writing for _PC Magazine_:

> Twitter is finally removing the 140-character limit in Direct Messages. Starting next month, users can send DMs the that are up to 10,000 characters in length.

Fantastic news, but it comes right on the heels of [Dick Costoloâ€™s sacking](http://mobile.nytimes.com/2015/06/12/technology/dick-costolo-twitter-ceo-jack-dorsey.html). I wonder if he opposed this change of if the two moves are completely unrelated. In any case, this will be great for users and in the long run, probably for Twitter as well.

That said, the question needs to be asked: how long before they remove this limit for regular tweets too, not just DMs?
