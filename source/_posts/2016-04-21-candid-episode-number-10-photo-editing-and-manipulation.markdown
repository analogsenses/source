Our 10th episode ran a bit longer than usual, but is packed with interesting stuff. The main topic this week is photo editing: how much we edit, what tools we use, our views on the ethics of photo manipulation, owning vs. renting your software, and whether itâ€™s ok to deliver RAW files to clients.
