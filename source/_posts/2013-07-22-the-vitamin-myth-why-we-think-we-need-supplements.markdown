The Atlantic:


<blockquote>The logic is obvious: if fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants -- and people who eat lots of fruits and vegetables are healthier -- then people who take supplemental antioxidants should also be healthier.

In fact, they're less healthy.</blockquote>



Fascinating read. I always thought vitamins were good for us although I never really knew _why_ they were good for us. Personally I've never taken any kind of dietary supplements or multivitamin pills. Instead, I always relied upon grandma's lessons: eat healthy, natural foods, avoid sugary drinks, eat your vegetables and so on. Taking vitamin pills just for the sake of it always seemed kind of wrong to me.
