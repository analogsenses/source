Kenneth Chang, The New York Times:

>The Philae has landed.

>The European Space Agency’s ambitious attempt to place a spacecraft on the surface of a comet succeeded when a signal arrived at the mission control center at Darmstadt, Germany, just after 5 p.m . local time (11 a.m. Eastern time).

What a historic achievement for Science. 

See also, [xkcd's live coverage of the landing](http://xkcd.com/1446/). Brilliant as always.
