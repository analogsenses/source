I came across this [on Seth Godin's blog today](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2014/09/the-shameful-fraud-of-sorting-for-youth-meritocracy.html), and it's worth a link even though it's nearly two years old. It's an amazing talk he gave at TEDxYouth back in 2012, where he asks a truly important question:

<blockquote>
What is school for?
</blockquote>

He goes on to make an incredibly relevant critique of the modern school system, and how we can fix it. Be sure to also take a look at [the manifesto](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/files/stopstealingdreams-screen.pdf) for more in-depth information.

Really, really great stuff.
