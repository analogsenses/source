[The Unfollower | Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/2013/01/25/the-unfollower/)



<blockquote>Here’s my position: I’m not publishing a newspaper that you’ve purchased. _You_ walked into _my_ house. I’m OK with you hanging around, but 100% of the rules are made by me, and 100% compliance is absolutely mandatory. You get _zero_ say in my content. There is no Letters Page for your complaint. You can’t ask to talk to my superior, because I’m at the top of the tree - and I’m going to agree with _me_.</blockquote>



This is a great article. Social networks are chock-full of people who love telling you what you should write (and specially NOT write) about. I like where Matt stands: My house, my rules. If you don't like what you see, you're free to leave. Just don't bother telling me about it: I simply do not care.
