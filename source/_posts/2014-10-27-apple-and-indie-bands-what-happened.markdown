Interesting piece by Nathan Mattise at Ars Technica:

> Feist wasn't the first musician to launch off the strength of an Apple commercial; the trend had gained enough attention that The New York Times asked “[Is Apple the Oprah for indie bands?](http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/09/30/is-apple-now-the-oprah-for-indie-bands/)” But in the years after "1234," Apple commercials became a less reliable way for bands to make it big. Lightning didn’t strike in the same way for [The Submarines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZrZB_ZxbL0), [Chairlift](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ftTaWwtbvgM), or the [Ting Tings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CVTTE4YtLyA), for instance—and that trio is likely the most notable bunch of the post-2007 Apple ad soundtracks.

> Today, the [multi-year streak](http://www.applemusic.info/) when lesser-to-unknown acts caught their break via iDevice ads seems to have ended. When Apple used an [unknown Willy Moon](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1550078/willy-moon-talks-apple-sync-and-throwback-debut-album) for its bouncy iPod reboot spot in 2012, the song (“Yeah Yeah”) only sold 155,000 copies in six months, according to [Billboard](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/1550078/willy-moon-talks-apple-sync-and-throwback-debut-album). (Feist's single sold 180,000 copies within a single month.) So sorry, [Julie Doiron](http://www.cbc.ca/nb/mt/east-coast-music/2014/07/julie-doiron-lands-song-on-new-apple-ad.html), you may be a few years too late.

> What changed?

I still have an iTunes playlist called "Apple Music", which is comprised solely of artists whose music I discovered thanks to Apple events and TV ads. Now that I think of it, it's true that I haven't added any new albums to that list in a pretty long time.
