[The Roast in the Fridge | Medium](https://medium.com/editors-picks/91cb6a257e4e)

Erika Hall writes an amazing piece over at Medium:



<blockquote>Well into the 21st century, billions of women and girls are still denied the ability to simply live their lives, control their bodies, and pursue their personal ambitions. All too often—that is to say way more than never—blameless life choices result in a death sentence. Even in our affluent “innovative” disembodied internet culture, outspoken women are viciously mocked and threatened in an attempt to silence them.</blockquote>
