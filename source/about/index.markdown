I was born in 1983 in [Plasencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasencia), a walled city in Western Spain, small in size but steeped in History. The time was 1:05 a.m., it was Summer and it also happened to be Tuesday. 

Flash-forward 33 years and change, and I’m now a Telecommunication Engineer with a Master’s degree in Bioengineering and Telemedicine. For six years I used to work at a research group at Technical University of Madrid (UPM), developing apps for several research projects, of both national and international scope. I left the University in 2014 and these days I’m trying to establish myself as an independent developer, writer, and photographer.

My eyes are green, just like my mother’s, and my favorite smell in the world is that of freshly brewed coffee, specially early in the morning.

If we’ve ever met, I’ve probably tried to take a picture of you at some point. Over the past few years, my relationship with photography has quickly grown from hobby to passion to love to business, and now I’m hooked. Besides taking pictures every day, I’m also one of the co-hosts of the photography podcast [Candid](http://www.candid.fm), alongside my friends [Josh Ginter](http://thenewsprint.co) and [Marius Masalar](https://mariusmasalar.me).

In mid-2014 I was diagnosed with [Type-1 Diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1), which means my body cannot regulate my blood-sugar levels on its own.
