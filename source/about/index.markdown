I was born in 1983 in [Plasencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasencia), a walled city in Western Spain, small in size but steeped in History. The time was 1:05 a.m., it was Summer and it also happened to be Tuesday. 

Flash-forward 31 years and change. I'm now a Telecommunication Engineer, and for the past 6 years I used to work at a Bioengineering and Telemedicine research group at Technical University of Madrid (UPM). I worked there as a mobile app developer in several research projects, with both national and international scope. These days I'm trying to establish myself as an independent writer, developer and maker of cool things.

My eyes are green, just like my mother's, and my favorite smell in the world is that of freshly brewed coffee, specially early in the morning. I like to keep a nice fountain pen and a Moleskine notebook with me at all times, usually in the company of whatever book I'm reading. I love crime fiction and classic adventure stories, but I enjoy reading all sorts of things, both fiction and non-fiction.

As of mid-2014 I've been diagnosed with [Type-1 Diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1), which means my body cannot regulate my blood-sugar levels on its own.

[alvaroserrano.com](http://alvaroserrano.com) is my rarely updated personal website, written in Spanish.

Analog Senses is powered by the wonderful [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) and uses my customized version of the [Readify theme](https://github.com/vladigleba/readify) by [Vladi Gleba](http://vladigleba.com), which is available under [the MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

The body font is [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova), which should improve readability, especially on high-resolution (a.k.a. Retina) displays.
