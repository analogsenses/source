**Analog Senses** is an attempt to provide a human look at the tech world, featuring articles, links and quotes about the Digital Life and other interesting stuff currently happening on planet Earth. It is written and produced by **Álvaro Serrano**.

You can find out more about me and why I started this site [here](http://analogsenses.com/2009/11/10/238565026/).

Analog Senses was inspired by the work of some incredibly talented people. [Here's](http://analogsenses.com/2009/11/10/239397612/) a tribute to them, with my gratitude.

I was born in 1983 in [Plasencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasencia), a walled city in Western Spain, small in size but steeped in History. The time was 1:05 a.m., it was Summer and it also happened to be Tuesday. My dad would never admit it, but despite this being his second time having a son, he didn't really have a clue what to do. That's OK, I guess, after all neither did I.

Flash-forward 30 years and change. I'm now a Telecommunication Engineer working at Technical University of Madrid (UPM). I work as a mobile app developer in Bioengineering and Telemedicine research projects, with both national and international scope. I'm also a self-proclaimed Nerd and Maker of Things, which means I'm constantly in need of a creative outlet. Hence, this website.

My eyes are green, just like my mother's, and my favorite smell in the world is that of freshly brewed coffee, specially early in the morning. I like to keep a nice pen and a Moleskine notebook with me at all times, usually in the company of whatever book I'm reading. I love crime fiction and classic adventure stories, particularly if there's a cheeky, morally ambiguous character somewhere in them.

As of mid-2014 I've been diagnosed with [Type-1 Diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1), which means my body cannot regulate my blood-sugar levels on its own.

[alvaroserrano.com](http://alvaroserrano.com) is my rarely updated personal website, written in Spanish. You could think of it as a distant relative of Analog Senses. The basic premise is the same for both sites, but the content there is less focused on technology and the Digital Life, and more about personal stories, experiences and the like. If you understand Spanish, you may find something interesting over there.
