Although I live in Madrid -- the best city in the world -- I was born in 1983 in [Plasencia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasencia), a walled city in western Spain, small in size but steeped in History. The time was 1:05 a.m., it was Summer, and it also happened to be Tuesday. My eyes are green, just like my mother’s, and my favorite smell in the world is that of freshly brewed coffee, specially early in the morning.

In mid-2014 I was diagnosed with [Type-1 Diabetes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_mellitus_type_1), which means my body cannot regulate my blood-sugar levels on its own.

I'm a scientist at heart, and a Telecommunication Engineer by trade. I also hold a Master’s degree in Bioengineering and Telemedicine. In the beginning of my career I used to work at a research group at Technical University of Madrid (UPM), developing apps for several medical research projects, of both national and international scope. I left the University in 2014 and for the next 3 years I worked as an independent software developer, writer, and photographer. 

However, as entertaining as self-employment can be, by 2017 I felt like I really needed a change, and I decided to embark on a new career path as an R&D consultant. After a seven-year stint at Ayming, in 2024 I joined Deloitte Spain's Gi^3 branch, where I manage the R&D Tax Incentives team.

If we’ve ever met, I’ve probably tried to take a picture of you at some point. Over the past decade, my relationship with photography quickly grew from hobby to passion to business, and now to everlasting love. Besides taking pictures every day, I used to be one of the co-hosts of the photography podcast [Candid](http://www.candid.fm), alongside my friends [Josh Ginter](http://thenewsprint.co) and [Marius Masalar](https://mariusmasalar.me). These days, I alternate my focus -- pun intended -- between [travel](http://instagram.com/analogsenses) and [boudoir](http://instagram.com/aserranoboudoir) photography.

## Colophon

Analog Senses is powered by the wonderful [Octopress](http://www.octopress.org) and uses my customized version of the [Readify theme](https://github.com/vladigleba/readify) by [Vladi Gleba](http://vladigleba.com), which is available under [the MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT). The site is hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).

Special plugins used include [Footnotes Popover](https://github.com/mattgemmell/footnotes-popover) by [Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com), [Octopress Responsive Video Embed](https://github.com/optikfluffel/octopress-responsive-video-embed) by Udo Kramer, and [Octopress Spotify Play Button](https://github.com/mrcasals/octopress_spotify_play_plugin) by Marc Riera.

Custom Web fonts used throughout the site include [Garden Grown](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/cultivated-mind/garden-grown/) and [Bebas Neue](http://www.fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/) in the site’s header and also in the titles and headings. The body font is [Proxima Nova](https://typekit.com/fonts/proxima-nova), which should improve readability, especially on high-resolution (a.k.a. Retina) displays.

Images used to be hosted on [Flickr!](http://www.flickr.com/photos/analogsenses/) but, as of August 2025, they are now self-hosted and served by Github Pages, along with the rest of the site.

On the software front, Analog Senses is written and produced using [Smultron](https://itunes.apple.com/app/smultron-6/id692204913?mt=12), [Git](http://git-scm.com), [GitHub](https://github.com), Terminal.app, and the Safari Web Browser on a Mac. Easy.
