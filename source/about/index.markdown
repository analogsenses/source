**Analog Senses** is an attempt to provide a human look at the tech world, featuring articles, links and quotes about the Digital Life and other interesting stuff currently happening on planet Earth. It is written and produced by [Álvaro Serrano](http://analogsenses.com/alvaroserrano/).

You can find out more about me and why I started this site [here](http://analogsenses.com/2009/11/10/238565026/).

Analog Senses was inspired by the work of some incredibly talented people. [Here's](http://analogsenses.com/2009/11/10/239397612/) a tribute to them, with my gratitude.
