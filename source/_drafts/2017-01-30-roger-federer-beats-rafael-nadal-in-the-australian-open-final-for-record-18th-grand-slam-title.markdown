Last Sunday was a historic day for tennis. Roger Federer, arguably the greatest male player of all time, defeated long-time rival Rafael Nadal in a gruelling five-setter in the final of the Australian Open.

With the win, Federer extends his record haul of Grand Slam singles titles to 18, and becomes the first man ever to win five or more singles titles at three different Slams: seven at Wimbledon, five at the US Open and five at the Australian Open. And at 35, he is also the oldest man to win a Grand Slam singles title in 45 years.

Those are the facts. Their significance, however, requires further consideration.

##A man on a mission

Federer's achievement is remarkable by itself, but what makes it even more incredible is the fact that he was just coming off a six-month hiatus, after missing the second half of the 2016 season because of a torn meniscus that required extended rest and rehabilitation in order to fully heal. For nearly everyone else, such a serious injury at 35 would have pretty much been a career-ending event. 

Thankfully, if we've learned something from Roger Federer’s illustrious career, it's that he isn't quite like everyone else.

That's not to say the injury wasn't a considerable setback for the Swiss, of course. The decision to put an end to the season early must have been a crushing one to make, as it meant he would miss his last chance to win the singles gold medal at the Olympics, the only high-profile title missing from his resume. He would also go on to miss the US Open and the ATP World Tour Finals for the first time in over a decade, as well as dropping out of the top ten for the first time in over 14 years (!). For a competitor as fierce as Federer, watching from the sidelines as the tour went on without him must have been excruciating.

Great athletes aren't those who never lose, but those who endure defeat and still find the resolve to come back even stronger. Throughout his long career, Federer has endured his fair share of setbacks on the court and nearly always managed to bounce back in style. However, this was the first time he had to overcome an injury of this caliber. Whether he had what it takes to bounce back from this, too, especially at 35, was anyone's guess.

Now, six months later and with yet another Grand Slam title to his name — 18 and counting — he should find comfort in knowing he made the right call.

##A tough journey

Federer's 2017 Australian Open campaign was the toughest he's ever had to endure en route to a Grand Slam title. He started against a familiar opponent: Jurgen Melzer. Nearly the same age as Federer and a former top-ten player, he's definitely not your typical first-round opponent. Federer managed to pull through in four sets, but there were obvious signs of rust in his game. 

##The ultimate test

Courage is defined as grace under pressure, and nobody embodies that quality better than Roger Federer. For those lucky enough to be there, it was on full display in Rod Laver Arena on Sunday, when the Swiss fought his heart out to overcome a 1-3 deficit in the deciding set, reeling off five straight games to claim the title against his ultimate rival.

There was a time, not too long ago, when that outcome would have been considered impossible.

Nadal and Federer are, without question, two of the greatest tennis players ever, but their rivalry has been a rather lopsided one. Going into Sunday's final, Nadal comfortably led the series 23-11, having won their previous six Grand Slam matches — including four finals. In fact, Federer hadn't beaten Nadal in a Grand Slam match in almost ten years, with his last win over the Spaniard coming in the 2007 Wimbledon final. Clearly, nobody in their right mind expected Federer to reverse that trend at 35 years of age, especially coming off an extended lay-off.

And yet, here we are. Tennis can be funny that way.

To be fair, Nadal was coming off an injury himself, having missed the later part of the 2016 season due to some issues in his left wrist that forced him to end the season in October, after losing in the second round of the Shanghai Masters 1000 event. Together with his gruelling five-hour semifinal against Grigor Dimitrov and the fact that he had one less day to recover, it just might have been enough to give Federer a legitimate shot at the title.

Then again, this wasn't the first time Federer had gone into a final looking good enough to beat Nadal on paper, only to end up losing. If Federer wanted to win this, he sure had his work cut out for him. 

The match itself was one for the ages. Federer pulled ahead in the scoreboard first by winning the opening set, only to see Nadal immediately level the match. The same story occurred over the third and fourth sets: Federer would open up a lead, only to see Nadal recover and force the decider. And then a familiar pattern started to emerge.

Federer's game faded just enough for him to drop serve in the opening game of the fifth set, and suddenly it appeared the writing was on the wall for the Swiss. After three hours of intense, nail-biting play, yet another Grand Slam final was slipping away, fast.



##Redefining greatness

Roger Federer is as athlete for the history books. He's the most decorated male player in Grand Slam history, yes, but his legacy transcends the sport in a way very few athletes can. It's not just about winning more than anyone else, but about elevating the game into a whole new dimension. Simply put, nobody else can do what he does on a tennis court. And he makes it look so easy.

When you watch Roger Federer play, something I've been lucky enough to do a few times in person, you're witnessing something truly special. You can feel it in the way he moves around the court, as effortless and precise as a ballet dancer. You can also see it in his grit and determination when it matters most, and the sheer speed and power of his groundstrokes. And you can see it in his ever graceful attitude towards his rivals. Win or lose, he's the best ambassador the sport could have asked for.

As a Federer fan, it's immensely satisfying to see that the most elegant and classiest of players is also the most successful. That, however, is a rare occurrence in sports, and all the more reason to celebrate this unique athlete and enjoy every one of his matches while we still can. 

The current era in tennis is largely defined by physical prowess: athleticism, speed, and power often decide the outcome of a match. Now, make no mistake: he may not look like it, but Roger Federer is one of the most physically gifted athletes on the planet. He certainly possesses all of those traits to a considerable degree, but he also embodies technique, finesse, and magic. His game is a near-perfect blend of classic and modern tennis, and that makes him arguably the most unique player ever to set foot on a tennis court.

One day, someone will beat Federer's record of Grand Slam titles, but that's OK. Records are meant to be broken, and it may not even take long — both Djokovic and Nadal are within striking distance, after all. But even if his records ultimately fall, there will never be another player quite like Federer. Just like Michael Jordan or Muhammad Ali did, he's changed the game forever.
