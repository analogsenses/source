The latest electric car from Tesla is finally out:

> Walk toward the car and it will paint you with powerful magic Tesla calls “ultrasonics,” which assess your trajectory, and open the door for you when you want to get in. Sit your butt down, apply brake, and the door will shut without any further input.

> How does it avoid slamming into things? Ultrasonics, of course. They constantly sound the area around the car to open doors to the maximum degree possible without inadvertently bumping anything.

I've always thought of Teslas as the kind of car James Bond would drive — if they were made in England by Aston Martin, of course.
