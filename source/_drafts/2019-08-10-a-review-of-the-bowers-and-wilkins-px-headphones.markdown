When buying a pair of noise-cancelling headphones, you're confronted with a quite a few choices: build quality, sound quality, battery life, noise cancellation, comfort, ease of use, and price, to name but a few. All of these are important, but of course not all are _equally_ important to every user. And therein lies the rub.

If you like making informed decisions whenever possible, choosing a pair of headphones sounds tedious, at best. However, most of the time, _discarding_ unsuitable headphones is very easy. Too expensive? Out. Sounds like crap? Out. Feels plasticky? Out. All of the above?[^BWPX1] _Way out_. You get the idea.

[^BWPX1]: Beats, I'm looking at you.

But what if you find a pair of headphones that sound _amazing_ but aren't especially comfy? Or what if their noise cancelling is top-notch but their sound quality doesn't quite get you excited? What if they sound great _and_ their ANC is awesome, but their connectivity sucks? None of those tradeoffs are easy to make, and different people will naturally pick different compromises.

Fortunately, none of those compromises are _huge_, in the big scheme of things. All of today's ANC headphones are actually great products, and the variations between them are fairly small. Simply put, there aren't any bad choices to be made out there, which should help take some pressure out of the equation.

If you're reading this, though, chances are you're at least a little bit like me, in that a good enough choice isn't actually good enough for you. You want _the best_. Hence all the hours spent reading about headphones on the Internet and watching YouTube video reviews. Trust me, I get it. I do it too.

The bad news — let's get that out of the way — is that the perfect headphones still don't exist. We're getting close, sometimes _really_ close, but we're still not quite there. Sorry.
