It's already October, I kid you not. Time is flying by at an incredible pace, fueled in part by the Internet's insatiable thirst for controversy. First it was ad blockers, then speculation over whether demand for the new iPhones has been lower this year, despite Apple's announcement of record sales numbers for the launch weekend. Go figure.

Luckily, as ever, there was more to the week than controversy. Let's get to it.

##Issue \#17: Angering Apple, ideal workspaces, revisiting comics, and remembering Alex King

This week's issue tries to stay away from thorny issues and focuses instead of some great reads for you to enjoy this weekend.

###[iFixit app pulled from App Store | Kyle Wiens →](http://ifixit.org/blog/7401/ifixit-app-pulled/)

The guys over at iFixit tore down the new Apple TV a few days ago. This was no ordinary teardown, however, as the device was a pre-production unit loaned to them by Apple as part of a development kit. Understandably, this is what happened:

> A few days later, we got an email from Apple informing us that we violated their terms and conditions—and the offending developer account had been banned. Unfortunately, iFixit’s app was tied to that same account, so Apple pulled the app as well. Their justification was that we had taken “actions that may hinder the performance or intended use of the App Store, B2B Program, or the Program.”

> Live and learn.

I think Apple chose to make an example of them in order to prevent these things from happening again in the future. Perhaps it was a bit excessive on Apple's part — we're talking about iFixit here, after all, teardowns is what they do — but it's hard to argue that Apple's actions were unjustified.

The lesson Apple would like everyone to learn from all this is crystal clear: _if you're a developer and work with any of our platforms, don't piss us off, or else._

Not very edifying, but it sure as hell will do the trick.

###[Tweetbot 4 for iOS review | Glenn Fleishman →](http://www.macworld.com/article/2988320/social-media/tweetbot-4-for-ios-review-twitter-client-adds-split-view-activity-monitor-other-improvements.html)

Another fantastic review of Tweetbot 4:

> Tweetbot better reflects how I use Twitter, keeping categories and kinds of things separate. Most critically, it incorporates a sophisticated set of mute options, which can be used effectively to avoid unfollowing or blocking people or groups during periods of time (or even forever) that you don’t want to have their tweets in your timeline. At $10—$5 during an introductory period—I have a hard time arguing against its value, especially for those who post from more than one Twitter account.

This is what I find most important about 3rd-party Twitter clients: they don't necessarily offer the entire Twitter experience, maybe not even the _best_ Twitter experience — whatever that is — but the one that better adapts to how _you_ use the service. That's why there will always be a market for well-designed, well thought-out Twitter clients beyond the official app.

###[The developer's MacBook | Rob Rhine →](http://martiancraft.com/blog/2015/08/macbook-for-developers/)

If you’ve ever wondered whether the new MacBook is suitable for serious development work, you need to read this:

> **Not enough power.** The Macbook is the least powerful machine in the current Mac line-up. In fact, you’d have to [go back a few years to find an Apple laptop of comparable speed](http://www.anandtech.com/show/9136/the-2015-macbook-review/9). However, processing speed is less important than you think for development. Sure, the Swift compiler can take its time, but if you compare compile time on an average-sized project between the MacBook and a contemporary Apple laptop, you’ll find the difference measurable in seconds. Seconds.

> The truth is, most modern hardware is perfectly well equipped for development — especially when paired with current solid state storage. It has been for a while. [She’s a fast enough ship](https://vine.co/v/OiDz5OZYd0b).

###[What would your ideal workspace look like? | Shawn Blanc →](http://shawnblanc.net/2015/09/your-ideal-workspace/)

Last week, Shawn Blanc published this great piece on the importance of our working environment and the effect it can have on our productivity and creativity:

> Think to the last time you were deeply focused and concentrating on something enjoyable…

> Where were you? What was your posture like? Were you eating or drinking anything? Were you at a desk, on the couch, on the floor, outside? Was there any music or other sounds? Were you alone, or were other people around?

> The way you default to concentrating when you are doing something enjoyable can give you some insight into how you may best be able to concentrate when doing all of your work.

Very interesting. Better yet, Shawn's article prompted some very interesting responses, like [this one from Mike Bates](http://www.mbs-p-b.com/mbs-p-b/2015/9/28/on-the-ideal-creative-workspace), and [this one from Josh Ginter](http://thenewsprint.co/2015/10/01/my-ideal-workspace/). There are plenty of cool ideas for your own workspace in both pieces, so be sure to check them out.

###[WTF Comics Club reads Watchmen | Jordan West →](http://www.themarysue.com/wtfwatchmen/)

WFT Comics Club is a great initiative: a monthly reading group for women, trans, and femme-identified fans in Minneapolis. They're reading through some of the most iconic comics ever and trying to answer a very important question: would they still be considered must-reads if they were published today?

In their last issue, they tackled Alan Moore's _Watchmen_, one of the most critically-acclaimed comics — or, if you want to be a purist, _graphic novels_ — of all time. Surprisingly, their take is that, despite _Watchmen_'s many merits, it doesn't quite retain its status as a masterpiece in hindsight:

> _Watchmen_ has its merits, and its place in comics history, though perhaps overstated, is certainly well-deserved. Unfortunately, Moore was writing for a place and time that are now as much nostalgia as the comics he was reacting against, and the demographic for whom this book still holds the most appeal is no longer the dominant readership among comics fans. This groundbreaking graphic novel just doesn’t hold up to the sensibilities of readers for whom cynicism is not a selling point and whose superheroes exist as a part of _Watchmen_’s legacy, not in its shadow.

_Watchmen_ is one of my favorite comic books so, naturally, I vehemently disagreed with their take at first. However, after thinking about it some more I have to say, they're absolutely right. Of course they are. _Watchmen_ was a very important step forward for comic books back in the 80's, but the landscape has changed so much since then. Everything that made _Watchmen_ unique back then has been re-hashed so many times by now that any reader who comes to it from scratch today would be hard-pressed to find something particularly appealing about it.

_Watchmen_ is still a great comic book, it's just not very original anymore, as paradoxical as that may sound. That being said, I would very much recommend reading it today. Historical relevance aside, it's still a damn fine story.

###[The misery of a doctor's first days | Jessica Leigh Hester →](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/10/the-misery-of-a-doctors-first-days/408004/)

Medical residencies are brutal, and this excellent piece over at _The Atlantic_ shows you why:

> Her first week, she worked more than 80 hours on a general-surgery rotation, charting for her attending physician, checking patients’ vital signs, and trying to restart exhausted hearts long after her shifts ended. “There’s no way to get all of our work done in 80 hours,” she says. “Our supervisors can’t make the work go away.” When her pager beeped with a reminder to clock out for the day, she ignored it, she says, while the more senior physicians looked the other way. Like many of her fellow residents, she went entire days without eating. She was so drained that she was halfway out the door one day before remembering that she’d left an IV in a patient’s arm.

> Within her first month, she crumbled under the pressure. After she went to visit the hospital counselor—sobbing through the appointment—a few of her fellow residents told her to suck it up. Feeling frazzled and helpless just comes with the first year territory, they said. It’s a rite of passage. In his memoir _Intern_, the New York cardiologist Sandeep Jauhar describes residency as “brutal, like a kind of hazing.”>

###[Tesla Model X: This is it | Andrew P. Collins →](http://truckyeah.jalopnik.com/tesla-model-x-this-is-it-1733682873)

The latest electric car from Tesla is finally out:

> Walk toward the car and it will paint you with powerful magic Tesla calls “ultrasonics,” which assess your trajectory, and open the door for you when you want to get in. Sit your butt down, apply brake, and the door will shut without any further input.

> How does it avoid slamming into things? Ultrasonics, of course. They constantly sound the area around the car to open doors to the maximum degree possible without inadvertently bumping anything.

I've always thought of Teslas as the kind of car James Bond would drive — if they were made in England by Aston Martin, of course.

###[How to stay drunk on a dangerous camping trip | Marissa A. Ross →](http://munchies.vice.com/articles/how-to-stay-drunk-on-a-dangerous-camping-trip)

Fun — and practical — piece by Marissa A. Ross:

> **Ignore winesplaining.**

> These backpacking trips attract a lot of old white people that love going on and on about Burgundy, because if you don’t know a handful of mid-range producers that some random guy from Michigan has in his cellar, you don’t know anything about wine. Do not share your wine with these people. Much like dogs, you should never reward old white people for their bad behavior.

> **Bring whiskey.**

> Because you’re in the wilderness. It’s against the law not to have whiskey.

Sounds like sensible advice to me. Via [Coudal Partners](http://coudal.com/archives/2015/10/dont_bring_your.php).
