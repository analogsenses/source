In case you haven’t heard, our public [Candid FM Slack channel](https://goo.gl/forms/3eFt4JIdnliuFSHK2), which you’re very much welcome to join, is home to a lively discussion about the photography industry between a bunch of pretty awesome people. One of the recurring topics of conversation is, unsurprisingly, the classic mirrorless vs DSLR debate, and how it pertains to the industry as a whole.

That discussion was timely last week, as Canon’s CEO [publicly pledged](https://www.dpreview.com/news/3943910050/canon-ceo-we-will-go-on-the-offensive-in-the-mirrorless-camera-market) to “go on the offensive” in mirrorless, aiming to capture as much as 50% marketshare in 2018. Corporate bravado aside, it makes for interesting news and, if we're to take him at his word, the potential implications for the entire industry are difficult to ignore.

Now, our Slack channel is the rare place on the Internet where discussions like this can occur in a civilized manner, but in the larger world out there, the mirrorless vs. DSLR debate is usually… let’s just call it heated.

Those who claim mirrorless is the future often do so with an air of inevitability, as if time was undoubtedly on their side. They also tend to refer to DSLRs as clunky, gargantuan, and wholly inelegant devices, as opposed to the sleek and modern devices mirrorless cameras are quickly evolving into. To them, DSLRs are dinosaurs, and mirrorless technology the proverbial meteor that will wipe them out.

DSLR proponents, on the other hand, claim that superior ergonomics, durability and performance are all excellent reasons to stick with what they know. To them, DSLRs are professional tools, while mirrorless cameras are more like toys: fun to use for a while, but not something they’d trust with their livelihood. When it comes to real work, DSLRs are definitely the way to go.

Both sides make valid points, and the truth, as usual, lies somewhere in the middle. However, both sides of this particular discussion tend to miss a very important point.

I believe mirrorless technology is not by itself the silver bullet to kill DSLRs as we know them. Instead, it is merely the first step on a longer path towards the computerization of photography. Among other things, that journey means an increasing number of components in modern cameras are electronic instead of mechanical: high-resolution electronic viewfinders, real-time exposure preview, advanced in-camera software, built-in Wifi, touchscreens… these are all features that make cameras work and feel a lot more like computers than ever before.

Moreover, as industry leaders continue to solve long-standing limitations like rolling shutter or battery life, and as computational photography becomes more powerful and advanced, this trend is only going to accelerate in the future. Like it or not, we’re headed into a future of extremely advanced computers that take photos, replacing the primarily mechanical devices we’ve known for so long.

If you appreciate traditional camera design, you’re probably in for some disappointment over the coming years. We’ve seen it happen before in all sorts of industries, and it never ended well for the holdouts: from LP-buying audiophiles seeing their beloved record stores go out of business, to die-hard Blackberry users holding onto their mechanical keyboards for dear life. It’s just the way of the world, and a result of the relentless force of technological progress. For the new to succeed, the old must inevitably wither and die.

What to make, then, of Canon’s bold claims of mirrorless domination? Call me crazy, but I don’t like their chances.

Many industries have been disrupted by technology in the past, and the incumbents have rarely been able to maintain their leadership. Especially when that disruption is primarily driven by a shift towards the computerization of previously existing single-purpose devices.

The quintessential example of this is, of course, the modern smartphone. There are more than a few parallels to be drawn out of the current landscape, and I believe they are worth exploring in more detail.



Never bet against the computer

Canon is too big and dominant to fall. They’re just taking their time. Even incredibly dominant players can fall surprisingly quickly.

Exhibit A: Nokia had a global smartphone share of 50.9% in Q4 2007, the very same year the iPhone debuted. A mere 5 years later, its share was under 3%.

Canon owns the high-end professional market, where the money is. So even if mirrorless cameras become popular at the consumer level, they’ll still be fine.

Exhibit B: Blackberry was never the most successful smartphone maker in terms of unit sales, but they absolutely used to own the enterprise market. Their headsets were vastly preferred because of their rock-solid hardware keyboards and their comprehensive support for enterprise services like Microsoft Exchange. But guess what? That was no safety net, either.

Indeed, Blackberry’s global marketshare peaked at 20.1% in Q1 2009, roughly 6 months after the App Store debuted. Once again, that was no coincidence. The app store made the computer-like part of the iPhone 100 times more valuable than the phone part. It was the way of the future, and there would be no turning back.

The common thread? Both Nokia and Blackberry made great _phones_, with several more or less interesting smart features added on top. Their fatal mistake was to assume the most critical element to their long-term success was the phone part. They even had the arrogance to say so, publicly and proudly.

As it turns out, that phone part was not so difficult to figure out, after all. And worst of all – for RIM and Nokia, that is – it wasn’t even that important. The computer part, though? That’s a different story.

The more a product category turns computer-like, the harder it is for companies like Canon to stay competitive. Simply put, the industry is shifting out of their comfort zone, and the elements that will likely grow to become key competitive features are all areas where Canon’s expertise is limited, to put it mildly.



In order to create a successful product category, it helps to be first and it helps to be best.

Exhibit C: Microsoft was not first to the modern smartphone party, and despite putting out a pretty pretty decent product by all accounts, it wasn’t enough to overcome the new incumbents.

When it comes to the computerization of the camera, Canon won’t be first, and I very much doubt they have the skill to be best. Call me crazy, but I don’t like their odds.

Canon is still the most popular camera maker today, but the future isn’t so much about cameras as we know them; it is about computers that take photos. And I’m betting Sony can figure out how to make better cameras around their computers a lot faster than Canon can put better computers into their cameras. Especially now that they Sony has the lenses and the ecosystem in place to support their cameras.

Exhibit D: the most successful smartphone platform today, Android, skyrocketed to success not by copying the phone part of the iPhone, but the computer part of it. And Android wasn’t created by a phone company, it was created by Google.

As computational photography matures and smartphones become better for it, dedicated cameras will need to adapt. I don’t know who the dominant player will be, if any, but once again Sony is in a unique position to use the software skills they learned in making the Xperia phones and build it into their cameras. If there’s a company that’s starting first out of the blocks, they appear to be it.

Of course, in photography there’s a key hardware element that makes all the difference and that has nothing to do with computers and everything to do with photography: the sensor. Well, guess what? Sony already owns that market. They’ve already figured it out.

I’m not saying Canon is doomed, or making any bold predictions about the financial future of the company. But if I were sitting at Canon’s board of directors today, I’d be scared shitless.

And just to be clear, I don’t want Canon to fail. Strong competition is the best way to foster innovation, and the entire industry benefits from it. I don’t want to replace a single monopolistic player with another. I want there to be a healthy ecosystem with several strong players who are successful by virtue of different strengths. I want a thriving photography industry, and we need Canon to be an essential part of it. They bring decades worth of expertise, tradition, and love for the craft to the table, and I really don’t think we should get rid of all that.

But I am worried. On the surface, Canon appears to be healthy and profitable, but as we’ve seen, stronger companies have fallen. I fear we’re in the midst of a massive shift towards mirrorless technology and the computerization of photography. And I fear Canon may be ill-equipped to compete in that world.

To quote Hemingway:

“How did you go bankrupt?” Bill asked. “Two ways,” Mike said. “Gradually and then suddenly.”

Make no mistake, Canon: you’re in deep water, and the sharks are circling. This is not the time to leisurely swim ashore.
