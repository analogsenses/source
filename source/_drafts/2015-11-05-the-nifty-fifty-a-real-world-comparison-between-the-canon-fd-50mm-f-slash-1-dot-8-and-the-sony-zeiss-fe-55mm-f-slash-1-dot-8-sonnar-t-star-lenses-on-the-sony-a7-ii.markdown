I'll be the first to admit that this seems like a ridiculous comparison. The Canon lens is a legacy lens from a manual SLR system that was discontinued by Canon _decades_ ago. The Sony, on the other hand, is a brand-new autofocus lens with state-of-the-art optics. In fact, they're not even the same focal length, if we're being picky. On paper, the only similarity between these two lenses is their f/1.8 maximum aperture.

So why compare them at all, then?

The reality is that, as gorgeous as the Sony 55mm lens is, it's also quite pricey, coming in at roughly $1,000. Make no mistake though, if you're in the market for a high-end standard lens for your A7-series camera, the Sony lens is worth every single penny, but if all you want is a decent-enough and _affordable_ standard lens, the Sony doesn't exactly fit the bill. No other autofocus lens for the system does, as a matter of fact, which leads us to manual lenses.

The 50mm Loxia is another excellent standard lens, and it's also native to the E-mount system, but again, at $899 it's not exactly what you could call affordable. The same goes for the Mitakon 50mm f/0.95.

If we also add small and light to the list of requirements — not an unreasonable request at all these days — then we run out of candidate lenses entirely. The Rokinon 50mm f/1.4, while more reasonable in price at $399, is also quite bigger in size and weight. There goes the last remaining standard lens that is native to the E-mount system.

Which leads us to adapted lenses. 

If we're going with adapted lenses and we're still trying to keep things small, light and affordable, then the best candidates for the job are usually old Canon FD lenses. These are high-quality lenses from the 1970s and 1980s that were massively popular back in the day, which means they're still easy to find in pretty good condition today, and can often be purchased for just a few bucks.

Of course, going with adapted lenses means we will need an adapter. Luckily, there's a wealth of inexpensive adapters for these lenses. After doing some research, I decided to go with the Fotodiox FD-NEX adapter, which strikes a nice balance between price, features and build quality, in my opinion. This adapter works very well with both bayonet-mount and the older screw-mount FD lenses, which means no matter which FD lenses you buy, you're covered. There's also the Metabones adapter for those looking for something a bit fancier, but since low cost is a premise here, the Fotodiox is the one I recommend.

Now that we got that out of the way, there's the matter of choosing the right FD lens. Canon used to make a huge array of FD lenses back in the day, but since we're looking for a standard lens, our choices are limited to the 50mm range. Therefore, we have the 50mm f/1.8 (the classic nifty-fifty), the 50mm f/1.4, the 50mm f/1.2 and the more exotic 50mm f/1.2 L.

If you can get your hands on the 50mm f/1.4 lens, that's the one I'd recommend getting. It's only a few bucks more expensive than the f/1.8 version, and it has far better optical quality. In fact, the 50mm f/1.4 is the reference lens for the entire Canon FD system.

However, the f/1.8 version was by far the most popular of them all — if you own any FD lenses already, there's a pretty good chance you own this one — so that's the one I'll be using in this comparison.


##Build quality and ergonomics

How well does a $35 lens compare with a $1,000 lens? Well, about as well as you'd expect, although it's not a total sweep for the Sony.

Build quality-wise, the Sony is the clear winner. It has an all-metal body and feels decidedly premium in the hand, while the Canon was obviously designed for efficient mass production and as such, is mostly made out of plastic.

Another point in favor of the Sony is that, while the Canon lens is smaller and lighter, that advantage is rendered moot by the extra bulk that the necessary adapter introduces into the mix. And it's not just the bulk, mind you. Having a second mount to fiddle with means there's a slightly bigger risk of getting some dust particles on the rear element of the lens, or even the sensor.

Among the factors that the Canon has going for it is the fact that, unlike the Sony, this is actually a manual lens, meaning it has a built-in aperture ring, as well as a depth of field scale and hard stops at both ends of the focusing range. The Sony uses a focus by wire design, whereas with the Canon you actually get to focus manually yourself. Therefore, tactile feedback and focus accuracy are definitely better with the Canon lens, although admittedly there's not a huge difference between the two.

Now, since the Canon lens doesn't have electrical contacts to relay information back to the camera, you will be limited to shooting in manual or aperture priority modes. And since the camera is unaware of when you're focusing, you can't configure it to automatically engage magnification when you turn the focusing ring. Peaking does work, though, and you can always assign the magnification feature to one of the A7 II's customizable buttons (I have it mapped to the C1 button).

##Image quality

This is a real-world comparison, so I'm not going to be micro analyzing every small aspect of image quality or showing any sharpness charts. If that's what you're after, let me make things simple for you: the Sony lens is better. Like, _way_ better. It outperforms the Canon on every single metric. That's not the question here.

The question is, is the Sony better _in ways that matter to you?_ 

If all you want is to shoot nice pictures to put on Facebook, or on your website, chances are they'll be considerably downsized and severely compressed as JPEGs. In that case, is the difference between the two lenses really that noticeable? 

Let's take a look.
