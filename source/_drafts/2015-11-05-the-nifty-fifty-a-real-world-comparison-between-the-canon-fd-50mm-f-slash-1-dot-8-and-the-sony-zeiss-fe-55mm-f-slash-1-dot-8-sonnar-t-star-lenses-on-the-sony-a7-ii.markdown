I'll be the first to admit that this seems like a ridiculous comparison. The Canon lens is a legacy lens from a manual SLR system that was discontinued by Canon _decades_ ago. The Sony, on the other hand, is a brand-new autofocus lens with state-of-the-art optics. In fact, they're not even the same focal length, if we're being picky. On paper, the only similarity between these two lenses is their f/1.8 maximum aperture.

So why compare them at all, then?

The reality is that, as gorgeous as the Sony 55mm lens is, it's also quite pricey, coming in at roughly $1,000. Make no mistake though, if you're in the market for a high-end standard lens for your A7-series camera, the Sony lens is worth every single penny, but if all you want is a decent-enough and _affordable_ standard lens, the Sony doesn't exactly fit the bill. No other autofocus lens for the system does, as a matter of fact, which leads us to manual lenses.

The 50mm Loxia is another excellent standard lens, and it's also native to the E-mount system, but again, at $899 it's not exactly what you could call affordable. The same goes for the Mitakon 50mm f/0.95.

If we also add small and light to the list of requirements — not an unreasonable request at all these days — then we run out of candidate lenses entirely. The Rokinon 50mm f/1.4, while more reasonable in price at $399, is also quite bigger in size and weight. There goes the last remaining standard lens that is native to the E-mount system.

Which leads us to adapted lenses. 

If we're going with adapted lenses and we're still trying to keep things small, light and affordable, then the best candidates for the job are usually old Canon FD lenses. These are high-quality lenses from the 1970s and 1980s that were massively popular back in the day, which means they're still easy to find in pretty good condition today, and can often be purchased for just a few bucks.

Of course, going with adapted lenses means we will need an adapter. Luckily, there's a wealth of inexpensive adapters for these lenses. After doing some research, I decided to go with the Fotodiox FD-NEX adapter, which strikes a nice balance between price, features and build quality, in my opinion. This adapter works very well with both bayonet-mount and the older screw-mount FD lenses, which means no matter which FD lenses you buy, you're covered. There's also the Metabones adapter for those looking for something a bit fancier, but since low cost is a premise here, the Fotodiox is the one I recommend.

Now that we got that out of the way, there's the matter of choosing the right FD lens. Canon used to make a huge array of FD lenses back in the day, but since we're looking for a standard lens, our choices are limited to the 50mm range. Therefore, we have the 50mm f/1.8 (the classic nifty-fifty), the 50mm f/1.4, the 50mm f/1.2 and the more exotic 50mm f/1.2 L.

If you can get your hands on the 50mm f/1.4 lens, that's the one I'd recommend getting. It's only a few bucks more expensive than the f/1.8 version, and it has far better optical quality. In fact, the 50mm f/1.4 is the reference lens for the entire Canon FD system.

However, the f/1.8 version was by far the most popular of them all — if you own any FD lenses already, there's a pretty good chance you own it — so that's the one I'll be using in this comparison.
