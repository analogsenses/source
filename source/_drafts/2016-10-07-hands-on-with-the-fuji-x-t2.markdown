Fuji has been pretty busy lately. The company made arguably the biggest splash at Photokina 2016 by announcing an entire new Medium Format system, including the new GFX camera and an astonishing _six_ lenses, to be released over the next few months.

These were by far the most sought-after announcements at Photokina — after all, it's not every day that you get to play with a 50-Megapixel Medium Format beast. Naturally, hands-on time was _extremely_ limited, even more so considering the camera  — yes, there was only one — is still a pre-production unit.

Unfortunately I didn't manage to get my hands on the GFX, but for what it's worth, it looks like an impressive system. It's certainly bigger and bulkier than Hasselblad's new X1D camera, but it remains roughly the same size as a Canon 5D-series, which is a remarkable achievement. If Fuji's price claims — well under $10k for the camera with one lens — end up being true, it will also be significantly more affordable than the rest of its Medium Format competitors. In fact, the GFX has the potential to turn Medium Format digital photography into a feasible option for a wider range of professional photographers, not just those operating in extremely high-end, niche areas. 

However the situation plays out, Medium Format digital photography is here to stay. For now, both Hasselblad and Fujifilm's offerings appear to have their fair share of strengths and weaknesses, so we'll see which one resonates more with prospective customers. The game is most definitely on.

Fuji may have captured the attention of many eyeballs at Photokina with the GFX, but the real star of their hands-on area was, of course, the recently announced X-T2. As the new flagship of Fuji's widely acclaimed X-series system, the X-T2 fixes many of the shortcomings of the original X-T1 while staying true to its essence. I had a chance to shoot with it for a while during the event, as well as to chat about it at length with Fuji employee Peter Fawland, and I have to say I came away very impressed. If you want to listen to my conversation with Peter, check out [this special episode of Candid](), which was recorded on location at Photokina. And now, let's take a closer look at the camera.


##Design and build quality

The Fuji X-T2's body is a joy to hold and use. It looks very similar to the X-T1's, but it has some improved ergonomics and controls. The grip is deeper now, making it easier to use with longer lenses, and there's a switch on the top of the ISO and mode dials that locks/unlocks their position with a single click, instead of having to keep pressure on the switch as you rotate the dial. These subtle differences make using the camera even better than before, which is saying a lot.

The new body also has a tilting screen, which makes it easier to compose overhead or low shots. And since it can tilt in both portrait and landscape orientations, it is also more flexible than your typical tilting screen. It doesn't have a selfie mode, though, which may limit the camera's appeal as a video-blogging tool. Not that it matters much, since the X-T2's certainly appears to have set more ambitious goals for itself.
