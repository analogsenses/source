##Issue #5: on old Macs, 

###[Seven years on, a MacBook Pro prepares for El Capitan | Chip Sudderth →](http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/06/seven-years-on-a-macbook-pro-prepares-for-el-capitan/)

Apple hasn't increased the basic requirements of new OS X versions for a few years now, which is great news for those of us who [still own and use old Macs](/2014/05/21/upgrading-my-early-2008-24-imac-to-an-ssd/) every day. Basically, if your Mac is 64-bit capable, you're good to go. And since El Capitan is ostensibly optimized to increase performance and battery life on older Macs, upgrading this time around really does seem like a no-brainer.

###[Life is easier when you take the stairs | David Cain →](http://www.raptitude.com/2015/06/take-the-stairs/)

Another week, another winner by David Cain. I don't know how he keeps doing it, but he does:

> I think what most of us really want is an easier life, not necessarily a more wholesome one. We want less trouble and more enjoyment, probably more so than we want achievement and virtue. But what we often overlook is that embracing difficulty in certain places nets us a lot more ease than our usual “easy” ways. Putting in three hours a week at the gym is easier than being out of shape 24 hours a day. Studying is easier than sitting in an exam room not having studied. Doing a good job at work is easier than wondering when they’ll finally fire you.

> I’m used to thinking of ease and difficulty as a pretty straightforward dichotomy: we want more of one and less of the other. And maybe in a sense that’s true, but they are often found in the same place and come together as a package. A small amount of difficulty often serves as the gatekeeper to a large amount of ease.

Spot on, as usual. Beyond the quoted excerpt above, this particular phrase stands out: “_Fears tend to stay down once you walk over them once_”.

###[Run to the Devil: The Ghosts and the Grace of Nina Simone | Brian Phillips →](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/run-to-the-devil-the-ghosts-and-the-grace-of-nina-simone/)

Brian Phillips has been on fire lately. Just days before penning [one of the best articles](/2015/06/29/the-sun-never-sets-on-roger-federer/) on Roger Federer in recent memory, he published this incredible piece on the troubled life of Eunice Waymon, the incredibly talented girl who would grow up to become one of the most influential musicians of all time: Miss Nina Simone.

###[You're better than this, Europe | Nils Muiznieks →](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/opinion/youre-better-than-this-europe.html)

Great piece for _The New York Times_ on how recent immigration policy amendments made by several European countries are threatening refugees' right to asylum. Immigration is a very real problem in Europe, and the current situation is unsustainable. Sadly, in dealing with that problem, some governments appear to have forgotten the very principles of equality and solidarity the Union was founded upon.

###[Letter to my younger self | Pete Sampras →](http://www.theplayerstribune.com/pete-sampras-letter-to-my-younger-self/)

Pete Sampras, who was widely regarded as the best male tennis player of all time until a fella named Roger Federer started winning majors left, right and center, writes a letter to his 16-year-old self, when he was about to join the professional ATP circuit. Amazing.

###[Losing weight with Apple Watch | Matt Gemmell →](http://mattgemmell.com/losing-weight-with-apple-watch/)

This is a fantastic, in-depth analysis on how it's entirely possible to lose weight without making huge sacrifices, or changes to your life. A little effort every day, coupled with a bit of intelligent planning and a sound strategy goes a long way. And as as Matt notes, a tech gadget like the Apple Watch can be useful to track your progress and give you an extra bit of motivation, but it's very much not required.
