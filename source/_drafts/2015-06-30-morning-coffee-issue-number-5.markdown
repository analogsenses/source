##Issue #5: on old Macs, 

###[Seven years on, a MacBook Pro prepares for El Capitan | Chip Sudderth →](http://sixcolors.com/post/2015/06/seven-years-on-a-macbook-pro-prepares-for-el-capitan/)

Apple hasn't increased the basic requirements of new OS X versions for a few years now, which is great news for those of us who [still own and use old Macs](/2014/05/21/upgrading-my-early-2008-24-imac-to-an-ssd/) every day. Basically, if your Mac is 64-bit capable, you're good to go. And since El Capitan is ostensibly optimized to increase performance and battery life on older Macs, upgrading this time around really does seem like a no-brainer.

###[Life is easier when you take the stairs | David Cain →](http://www.raptitude.com/2015/06/take-the-stairs/)

Another week, another winner by David Cain. I don't know how he keeps doing it, but he does:

> I think what most of us really want is an easier life, not necessarily a more wholesome one. We want less trouble and more enjoyment, probably more so than we want achievement and virtue. But what we often overlook is that embracing difficulty in certain places nets us a lot more ease than our usual “easy” ways. Putting in three hours a week at the gym is easier than being out of shape 24 hours a day. Studying is easier than sitting in an exam room not having studied. Doing a good job at work is easier than wondering when they’ll finally fire you.

> I’m used to thinking of ease and difficulty as a pretty straightforward dichotomy: we want more of one and less of the other. And maybe in a sense that’s true, but they are often found in the same place and come together as a package. A small amount of difficulty often serves as the gatekeeper to a large amount of ease.

Spot on, as usual. Beyond the quoted excerpt above, this particular phrase stands out: “_Fears tend to stay down once you walk over them once_”.

###[Run to the Devil: The Ghosts and the Grace of Nina Simone | Brian Phillips →](http://grantland.com/hollywood-prospectus/run-to-the-devil-the-ghosts-and-the-grace-of-nina-simone/)

Brian Phillips has been on fire lately. Just days before penning [one of the best articles](/2015/06/29/the-sun-never-sets-on-roger-federer/) on Roger Federer in recent memory, he published this incredible piece on the troubled life of Eunice Waymon, the incredibly talented girl who would grow up to become one of the most influential musicians of all time: Miss Nina Simone.

###[You're better than this, Europe | Nils Muiznieks →](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/opinion/youre-better-than-this-europe.html)

Great piece for _The New York Times_ on how recent immigration policy amendments made by several European countries are threatening refugees' right to asylum. Immigration is a very real problem in Europe, and the current situation is unsustainable. Sadly, in dealing with that problem, some governments appear to have forgotten the very principles of equality and solidarity the Union was founded upon.

###[Letter to my younger self | Pete Sampras →](http://www.theplayerstribune.com/pete-sampras-letter-to-my-younger-self/)

Pete Sampras, who was widely regarded as the best male tennis player of all time until a fella named Roger Federer started winning majors left, right and center, writes a letter to his 16-year-old self, when he was about to join the professional ATP circuit. Amazing.

###[At the heart of the Wimbledon tennis championships lies the IBM bunker | Sebastian Anthony →](http://arstechnica.co.uk/information-technology/2015/07/exploring-the-ibm-bunker-the-brain-of-wimbledon/)

I really enjoyed Anthony’s peek into the brains of Wimbledon for _Ars Technica_. Organizing a Grand Slam event, like any major sports tournament in the world, takes a huge amount of effort, coordination, and technological prowess. This is how the magic happens.

###[Losing weight with Apple Watch | Matt Gemmell →](http://mattgemmell.com/losing-weight-with-apple-watch/)

This is a fantastic, in-depth analysis on how it's entirely possible to lose weight without making huge sacrifices, or changes to your life. A little effort every day, coupled with a bit of intelligent planning and a sound strategy goes a long way. And as as Matt notes, a tech gadget like the Apple Watch can be useful to track your progress and give you an extra bit of motivation, but it's very much not required.

###[Love | Brent Simmons →](http://inessential.com/2015/06/30/love)

Brent Simmons, the former lead developer of [Vesper](http://vesperapp.co), shares his thoughts on the current state of the indie app development industry:

> Yes, there are strategies for making a living, and nobody’s entitled to _anything_. But it’s also true that the economics of a thing may be generally favorable or generally unfavorable — and the iOS App Store is, to understate the case, generally unfavorable. Indies don’t have a fighting chance.

Brent's piece has been shared to death over the past few days, so you may have seen it already. The explanation for that is very simple: He's absolutely right. As much as it pains me to say it, the App Store’s promise of a sustainable ecosystem for indie developers to thrive in remains largely unfulfilled. There was a brief period in the beginning when things really were awesome. Then, after the initial gold rush subsided, things were still good. Now they just are. There are people like Marco Arment still manage to find success, but by and large, the expectations for aspiring indies in today's App Store are pretty bleak. 

Clearly Apple has some of the responsibility here. Their actions as steward of the platform haven't been focused on protecting indies and encouraging they can create sustainable businesses, and that's unfortunate.

###[Airbnb and the Internet revolution | Ben Thompson →](https://stratechery.com/2015/airbnb-and-the-internet-revolution/)

Great piece by Ben Thompson, as usual. Businesses like Uber and Airbnb are great examples of the endless possibilities for disruption enabled by the sharing economy, but they're also shady enterprises at their best, with many gray areas in the way they operate:

> I increasingly believe that it is the sharing economy that is beginning to reveal the answer: a world of commodified trust has significantly less need for much of the infrastructure of modern society, including inefficient sectors like hotels whose primary differentiator is trust, along with the regulatory state dedicated to enforcing that trust. On the other hand, this brave new world has brand new holes through which people can fall: those who have lost trust, or do not have the means to build it.

###[The real voice of Siri explains the art of voiceover | Phil Edwards →](http://www.vox.com/2015/6/23/8831131/siri-voiceover-susan-bennett)

I love these behind-the-scenes stories. Voice acting is a pretty well-established industry in Spain, where people have been watching mostly dubbed movies and TV shows for decades. The situation is starting to change over the past few years, as many people — especially younger people — start consuming more and more of their content through the Internet in its original form. Who would have thought that it'd take massively successful TV shows like [_Lost_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411008/) and [_Game of Thrones_](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/) for people to get serious about their English?

Anyway, this piece is a great look at some of the intricacies of voice acting, and who better to guide us through the process than Susan Bennett, the actress behind Siri’s original voice. A very entertaining read indeed.
