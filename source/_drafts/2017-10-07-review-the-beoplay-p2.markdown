Personal Bluetooth speakers have been a _very_ popular product category for the past few years. Coinciding with the maturity of the smartphone and, more importantly, the wealth of music streaming services available, we've seen a bunch of manufacturers flood the market with a bazillion different models of all sizes, shapes, colors, and price points. Of course, as could be expected in such a fragmented landscape, quality is all over the map and finding the right speaker is far from easy.

What's better, a $40 speaker that will die on you in 2h and sound tinny, or a $149 speaker that can keep going all day and won't make you want to stick a pencil through your eardrums? I know which one I'd prefer, but different people will have different budgets, and different tolerances for audio quality. And if you just want to annoy the hell out of everyone else in your subway car, well, then I guess none of this matters much to you.

That being said, things could be worse. You could be a discerning person with a reasonable budget and still end up buying an expensive speaker from a reputable brand, only to find out it's ridden with audio and connectivity issues. It happens because Bluetooth is a nasty protocol to begin with, and companies have been fiddling with it for years in a futile attempt to make it work seamlessly and reliable. It's a mess.

There's also the fact that tech companies may be good at making Bluetooth devices, but most of them don't really care about audio quality. Luckily, there are still companies out there with the technical chops required to make a decent Bluetooth device. And out of those, B&O Play is perhaps the one with the most high-fidelity audio expertise to back it up. So it's fair to say, if you're going to roll the dice on a new Bluetooth speaker, B&O Play is probably about as safe a bet as it gets.

I've been extensively testing several of their Beoplay speakers over the past few months, and I have to say I'm very impressed with the results. Today we're going to take a closer look at the tiny — but remarkably capable — Beoplay P2 Bluetooth speaker.
