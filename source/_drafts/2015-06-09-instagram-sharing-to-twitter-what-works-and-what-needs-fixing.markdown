Over the past couple of months I've been more active than usual in my photography. Thanks to the course I've been taking and thanks to a few photographer friends of mine, I've had some great opportunities to work with really talented models and it's been a terrific experience. I'm so happy I enrolled in the course and I'd definitely recommend anyone with an interest in photography to do the same.

A side effect of this increased photographic activity is that over the past few weeks I've also been sharing pictures on Instagram more often. I've never been crazy about Instagram but for all its faults, there's a really vibrant community of users there and it's one of the best places — probably _the_ best place — to share your pictures, even “real” pictures taken with a “real” camera instead of a smartphone.

If we compare Instagram to Flickr, the other photography-oriented social network in which I'm an active user, the differences are stark. While Flickr is all about showcasing your pictures in their original form, Instagram was always meant to share the magic of special moments conveyed through images more than actual photographs, and as such pays little attention to preserving detail or accuracy and instead emphasizes emotion over everything else. Filters are the perfect embodiment of that philosophy, with each filter sort of imbuing your images with a different mood. That ability to provoke an emotional response is what makes Instagram a great service used and loved by millions of people, and it's easy to understand why.

And yet, despite Instagram not being a service oriented towards the more academic or technical side of photography, more and more “serious” photographers are sharing their work there in recent years. Meanhwhile, Flickr just kind of continues to exist in some shape or form without many people really caring about it anymore. If I'm being honest, that saddens me a bit because I still love Flickr and I'd love nothing more than for it to really thrive again, but I guess that's just how things have played out

Unfortunately, and I don't mean to take anything away from Instagram's success here, sharing pictures from a dedicated camera on Instagram is not nearly as convenient as it could be.


##A matter of principles

When it comes to sharing pictures from a dedicated camera, there are several hurdles to jump through. The most obvious one is the fact that the only way to upload pictures to Instagram is through their smartphone apps, so before you can even begin to upload your images, you _must_ get them into your smartphone one way or another. That, as we’ll see in a minute, is not as easy as it seems.
