Despite some people's complaints about the recent lack of innovation in the photography industry, 2016 has been an awesome year. Nearly all manufacturers announced one or more new cameras over the past 12 months, including several new flagship models across different systems, and the current landscape offers many excellent choices for pretty much every type of photographer out there.

Now, it's true that most of the recent announcements have been more evolutionary than revolutionary, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Mirrorless technology has come remarkably far in just a few years, and this year we've seen how the rising tide of technology has finally made many cool features standard across different manufacturers and systems. 

Features like touchscreens, IBIS, and dual SD card slots are now available on many cameras, and the situation is only going to get better in the future. On top of that, as manufacturers continue to push high-ISO performance and dynamic range, sensor size is becoming less of a critical factor for those looking for solid image quality in a wide variety of scenarios.

With those aspects in mind, I've created this guide to help people figure out which camera is the right one to get depending on their particular needs. I'm also giving out the first Editor's Choice award in the history of _Analog Senses_ to the best camera of 2016, and the one I recommend for most people. To learn which camera took home the award, just keep reading!
