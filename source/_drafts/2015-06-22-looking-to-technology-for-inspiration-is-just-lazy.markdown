description:"Saying that a better camera or a better lens inspires you to go out more and take better pictures is not transformative, it's just lazy."

You already own the tools you need to create something amazing. Hoping for a technology upgrade to inspire you and make you a better creative person is missing the point entirely.

This camera is special. It inspires me to go out and shoot more.

It's not. It's really not.

This is a trick of the mind we're playing on ourselves, and it does a disservice to all of us.

When you find an artist whose work you love, there's a natural impulse to peek behind the curtain. We want to learn everything about that person's creative process, and the tools they use to create the work we so love. At that point, one of two things will happen. Either we find out that they use the latest and greatest technology, or we'll find out that they've managed to excel at their craft using merely average tools. In some cases, _really_ average tools.

I don't know about you, but I've found that I tend to prefer the work of those who use average tools. In most cases, those artists somehow manage to create even more soulful, more authentic work. Check out this kid who's capturing incredible macro shots with the cheapest lens there is. Or some of the most respected and renowned artists in history, who got by using centuries' old technology, simply because it's what was available to them.

Relying on technology to inspire us is missing the point entirely. Better tools are conducive to better output only up to a certain point, and in the case of photography, that point was met a long, long time ago.

In case you haven't noticed, there are no bad cameras anymore. You can spend $200 or $4,000, but that won't transform your creative output in any meaningful way.

Sure, you may genuinely believe that thanks to your new camera you're taking better images than ever, but here's the kicker: the ability to create those images was always within you. You just fooled yourself into thinking you weren't capable before.

Some people are unable to get past this stage. Others, however, are able to see that true creative potential always comes from within, not from some arbitrary piece of equipment.

You can buy Roger Federer’s racquet, but that won't make you any more of a tennis player. You can buy Henri Cartier-Bresson's camera, but that won't make you a better photographer.

Chances are, the tools you currently own are far more capable than you are to produce great work. By refusing to explore them to their full potential, you're only keeping yourself from growing as a creative person.

Stop making excuses. Stop acting as though your lack of work is the world's fault. “If only I had a better camera” only fools yourself.

There's a 15 year old kid that found a way to diagnose cancer by using only test strips. I'm sure somebody told that kid he was wasting his time, but gess

There are two types of photographer: the kind that won't even get to work unless you give them a Sony A7R Mark II and the kind that will knock your socks right off with a 40 year-old Polaroid camera. Which one do you want to be?
